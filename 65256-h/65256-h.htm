After extracting this detail from
my Journal, and supplying many
circumstances from my memory,
I was very much at a loss what
title to give it. <span class='sc'>Memoirs</span> seemed to answer
my design with the greatest propriety; but that
being so commonly misapplied, I was afraid
the public would expect a romance, where I
only intended laying down a few facts, for the
vindication of my own conduct. I do not,
however, by this mean to suggest to my reader,
that he will find here only a bare uninteresting
narrative; no, I have added all in my
power to make it useful and agreeable to others,
as it was necessary to myself; and indeed it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>highly so, since a person who bears ill treatment
without complaining, is generally held by
his friends pusillanimous, or believed to be withheld
by secret motives from his own justification.
I know not what mine think, but it will
not be amiss to inforce their good opinion of
me, by laying all my actions open to their view,
And as once publishing will be more general,
and save many repetitions of a disagreeable narration,
this motive first induced me to write,
to exchange my sword for a pen, that I wield as
a soldier, who never dreamt of the beauties of
stile, or propriety of expression. Excuse then,
gentle reader, all the faults that may occur, in
consideration that these are not my weapons, and
that tho’ I received almost as good an education
as Virginia could bestow on me, it only sufficed
to sit me for a soldier, and not for a scholar; but
tho’ this was the chief end I proposed from it, I
have, occasionally deviating from my main design,
added whatever I thought curious and
entertaining,<a id='tvi'></a> that occurred to my observation, in
the Cherokee country, and my travels to
and from it, not omitting the principal dangers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>I have passed through, and the expences I
have been at, that the reader, weighing them
and the rewards I have received, may judge
where the balance is due. I do not doubt but
I shall be censured for exposing so freely the
actions of Mr. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κακοανθροπος</span>; but to this I was
constrained by the clamours made against the
unnecessary and extravagant expences into
which the reception of the Indians had drawn
the government. To unveil where the unnecessary
and extravagance of it lay, became my
duty; and I cannot say but I took some pleasure
in detecting the person in the crime he so
arfully had laid to my charge: It is, I presume,
very pardonable in a person who has so
much reason to complain of his unfair practices
towards him. As to the manners of the
Indians, I grant they have been often represented,
and yet I have never seen any account
to my perfect satisfaction, being more frequently
taken from the reports of traders, as ignorant
and incapable of making just observations
as the natives themselves, than from the writer’s
own experience. These I took upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>spot, and if I have failed in relating them, it is
thro’ want of art in expression, and not of due
knowledge in point of facts. As, however, I
did not take upon me to write as an author who
seeks applause, but compelled by the necessity
of vindicating myself, I once more beg the public
to pass over, with a candid indulgence, the
many faults that may deserve their censure.</p>

Notwithstanding my aversion to
formal beginnings, and any thing
that may relish of romance, as
the reader may desire some
knowledge of the person who has submitted
his actions to his judgment, I shall, in hastening
to my principal design, just acquaint him,
that my father was an inhabitant of Virginia,
who dying while I was yet a minor, left me a
small fortune, no ways sufficient for my support,
without some employment. For some
time, by the advice of my friends, I proposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>following the more lucrative one of commerce,
but after my minorship was elapsed,
my genius burst out. Arms had been my delight
from my infancy, and I now resolved to
gratify that inclination, by entering into the
service. Pursuing this resolution, I made my
first campaign in the year 1756, with a company
of gentlemen called the Patriot Blues,
who served the country at their own expence;
but whether terrified by our formidable appearance,
or superior numbers, the enemy still
avoided us; so that, notwithstanding many
recent tracks and fires, we never could come
to an engagement. On our return, I made
application for a commission in the Virginia
regiment, then commanded by Col. Washington;
but there being at that time no vacancy,
I returned home.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year 1758, a new regiment was raised
for that year’s service, to be commanded
by the Hon. William Byrd, Esq; from whom
I not only received an ensigncy, but as subalterns
were to be appointed to a troop of light-horse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>he honoured me with the cornetcy of that also.
I was soon after ordered on an escort, in which
service I continued till July, when I joined the
army at Ray’s-Town, where I found General
Forbes already arrived. The army then
marched to Fort Ligonier, on the way to Fort
Du Quesne. I was seized here by a violent
fit of sickness, caught in searching for some
of the troop-horses that were lost, by overheating
myself with running, and drinking a
large quantity of cold water, which rendered
me incapable of duty. I got something better
about the time the troops marched for Fort Du
Quesne and could sit my horse when helped
on, but was ordered back by the General, who,
however, on my telling the doctor I hoped to
do duty in a day or two, permitted me to continue
the march. We heard the French blow
up their magazine, while yet some miles off;
and, on our arrival, we found the barracks,
and every thing of value, in flames. My malady
rather increased, so that I was at last compelled
to petition for my return. I lost my horse
at Fort Ligonier, the third I had lost during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>campaign; and being obliged to mount a very
weak one, I met with great difficulty in crossing
the Allegany mountains; and before I
reached Ray’s Town my horse was entirely
knocked up. I bought another, and proceeded
to Winchester, where, in a little time, I
got perfectly recovered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those light-horsemen that survived the
campaign, were herein want of all necessaries;
and no money being sent up from Williamsburg
to pay them, I advanced upwards of an
hundred pounds, intending to reimburse myself
from the first that should arrive; mean
while the troops I belonged to were disbanded,
and I, in consequence, out of pay. I had no
further business at Winchester than to wait for
this money, which I did, till my patience being
quite exhausted, I resolved to go down the
country in search of it. On my arrival at Williamsburg,
I was informed the money had
been sent up to me by the paymaster. I returned
immediately to Winchester, near 200
miles, where I found the paymaster had paid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>it to the Lieutenant of the troop, who had appropriated
it to his own use. He returned me
fifty pounds, but it has never been in his power
to pay me the remainder, and to all appearance
it never will.</p>

<p class='c011'>After such unfortunate essays I began to
give over all thoughts of the army, when
Col. Byrd was appointed to the command of
the old regiment, in the room of Col. Washington,
who resigned; on which I was unfortunately
induced to accept another commission.
I served another campaign in the year 1759,
under General Stanwix, in the same quarter;
but on our arrival at Pittsburg, formerly Fort
Du Quesne, I had little employment, except
looking over the men at work, till the fall of
the leaf, when the General gave me the command
of Fort Burd, about sixty miles to the
eastward of Pittsburg, where I continued
about nine months at a very great expence,
partly through hospitality to those who passed
to and from Pittsburg, and the dearness of necessaries,
and partly by building myself a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>house, and making several improvements, and
finishing the half-constructed fort, for which
I never received any gratuity. I was relieved
by a company of the Pensylvania regiment in
the spring, and returned to Pittsburg, but
found Col. Byrd with one half of the regiment
ordered against the Cherokees, now
become our most inveterate enemies; while
the remainder under Col. Stephen were destined
to serve on the Ohio. I will not fatigue
the reader with an account of campaigns
wherewith all our news-papers were filled,
but confine myself to what more immediately
concerned me.</p>

<p class='c011'>I remained at Pittsburg till autumn, when
I obtained permission to pass the winter at
home. I accordingly set out in company
with an Ensign named Seayres, who had obtained
the same permission: we found great
difficulties from the badness of the road, of
which I may quote the following instance.
After marching three whole days from Pittsburg
to the place where General Braddock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>first crossed the Yawyawgany river (little
better than sixty miles), and leaving one of my
horses fast in the mire, we found, to our
great surprise, the river about twelve feet high.
We waited a whole day in hopes of its falling,
but had the mortification to find it had rather
rose a foot; our provisions beginning to run
short, we hunted to recruit them, but without
any success, which obliged us to come to
an immediate determination. We at last resolved
to look for some other crossing-place;
we found about two miles lower, a part of the
river, which by its breadth we judged to be
fordable; but as the water was muddy, and
the bottom could not be seen, there was a
considerable risk in attempting it, especially
as it lay under a fall, from whence the current
darted with great impetuosity. After some
deliberation, we resolved to venture it; pushed
on by the fears of starving, if we remained
any longer where we were, Mr. Seayres proposed
himself to try it first; mounting therefore
the best of our horses, he plunged into
the stream: for the first hundred yards the water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>reached little higher than the horse’s belly,
but before he got to a small island in the middle,
which we had resolved to rest at, he was
quite up to the saddle-skirts; after halting a
little time, he set out again for the opposite
side, but found it impossible to proceed, a
deep channel lying between him and the shore,
into which he often plunged, but was as often
obliged to turn back, at a great hazard of being
carried away by the current. Despairing
at last of being able to cross it, yet unwilling to
return, he forced up the shallow part about an
hundred yards, towards the falls, making several
attempts to cross, which he at last effected;
but the banks being excessively steep, he
found as much difficulty and danger in climbing
them, as he had before done in crossing.
We then followed, and tho’ we now knew exactly
what course to keep, as our horses were
weaker, and more heavily loaded, our task
was not less dangerous or difficult. We found
the bottom so rocky and irregular, that the
horses staggered with their loads. The rapidity
of the stream, and the false steps they made,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>threatened every moment to leave their burthens
and lives in the middle of the stream.
One of them, on which my servant was
mounted, actually fell, letting my portmantua
into the water, which luckily lodged among
the limbs of an old tree, that had been washed
down by the current; the horse recovered
himself, and all the damage occasioned by this
accident was, the spoiling of my cloaths, and
to the amount of forty pounds in paper money,
which got so wet, and stuck so fast together,
that the greatest part of it was rendered
entirely useless. Happy, however, that this
was our only loss, and that we escaped with
our lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the spring 1761, I received orders to return
to my division, which was to proceed to
the southward, and join the other half against
the Cherokees. Soon after this junction we
began our march towards the Cherokee country.
Col. Byrd parted from us at a place called
Stalnakres, and returned down the country,
by which the command devolved on Col.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Stephen. We marched, without molestation,
to the great island on Holston’s river, about
140 miles from the enemy’s settlements, where
we immediately applied ourselves to the construction
of a fort, which was nearly completed
about the middle of November, when
Kanagatucko, the nominal king of the Cherokees,
accompanied by about 400 of his people,
came to our camp, sent by his countrymen to
sue for peace, which was soon after granted by
Col. Stephen, and finally concluded on the
19th instant. All things being settled to the
satisfaction of the Indians, their king told Col.
Stephen he had one more favour to beg of
them, which was, to send an officer back with
them to their country, as that would effectually
convince the nation of the good intentions
and sincerity of the English towards them.
The Colonel was embarrassed at the demand;
he saw the necessity of some officer’s going
there, yet could not command any on so dangerous
a duty. I soon relieved him from this
dilemma, by offering my service; my active
disposition, or, if I may venture to say, a love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>of my country, would not permit its losing
so great an advantage, for want of resolution to
become hostage to a people, who, tho’ savage,
and unacquainted with the laws of war or
nations, seemed now tolerably sincere, and had,
seeing me employed in drawing up the articles
of peace, in a manner cast their eyes upon me
as the properest person to give an account of
it to their countrymen. The Colonel seemed
more apprehensive of the danger than I was
myself, scarce giving any encouragement to a
man whom he imagined going to make himself
a sacrifice, lest he should incur the censure
of any accident that might befall me.</p>

<p class='c011'>The 28th was fixed for our departure; but,
on making some inquiries about our intended
journey, the Indians informed me that the rivers
were, for small craft, navigable quite to
their country; they strove, however, to deter
me from thinking of that way, by laying before
me the dangers and difficulties I must encounter;
almost alone, in a journey so much
further about, and continually infested with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>parties of northern Indians, who, though at
peace with the English, would not fail to treat,
in the most barbarous manner, a person
whose errand they knew to be so much against
their interest. They professed themselves concerned
for my safety, and intreated me to go
along with them: but as I thought a thorough
knowledge of the navigation would be of infinite
service, should these people even give us
the trouble of making another campaign
against them, I formed a resolution of going
by water; what much conduced to this, was
the slowness they march with when in a large
body, and the little pleasure I could expect in
such company. On the day appointed the Indians
set out on their journey, and a little after
I embarked on board a canoe to pursue
mine: my whole company consisted of a serjeant,
an interpreter, and servant, with about
ten days provisions, and to the value of twenty
odd pounds in goods to buy horses for our return:
this was all our cargo, and yet we had
not gone far before I perceived we were much
too heavy loaded; the canoe being small,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and very ill made, I immediately ordered my
servant out, to join the Indians, giving him
my gun and ammunition, as we had two
others in the canoe; little could I foresee the
want we were soon to experience of them.
We then proceeded near two hundred weight
lighter, yet before we had gone a quarter of a
mile ran fast a-ground, though perhaps in the
deepest part of the stream, the shoal extending
quite across. Sumpter the serjeant leaped
out, and dragged us near a hundred yards over
the shoals, till we found deep water again.
About five miles further we heard a terrible noise
of a water-fall, and it being then near night, I
began to be very apprehensive of some accident
in passing it: we went ashore to seek
the best way down; after which taking out
all the salt and ammunition, lest it should get
wet, I carried it along the shore, while they
brought down the canoe; which they happily
effected. It being now near dark, we
went ashore to<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> encamp about a mile below
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the fall. Here we found a party of seven or
eight Cherokee hunters, of whom we made
a very particular inquiry concerning our future
route: they informed us, that, had the
water been high, we might from the place
we then were reach their country in six days
without any impediment; but as the water
was remarkably low, by the dryness of the preceding
summer, we should meet with many
difficulties and dangers; not only from the
lowness of the water, but from the northward
Indians, who always hunted in those
parts at that season of the year. I had already
been told, and fortified myself against
the latter, but the former part of this talk (as
they term it) no way pleased me; it was however
too late, I thought, to look back, and so
was determined to proceed in what I had undertaken.
We supped with the Indians on
dried venison dipped in bears oil, which served
for sauce. I lay (though I was too anxious to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>sleep) with an Indian on a large bear-skin,
and my companions, I believe, lodged much
in the same manner.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. What is meant here by encamping, is only making a
fire and lying near it, though the Indians often prop a
blanket or skins upon small poles, to preserve them from
the inclemency of the weather.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Early next morning we took leave of our
hosts, and in less than half an hour began to
experience the troubles they had foretold us,
by running a-ground; we were obliged to get
out, and drag the canoe a quarter of a mile
before we got off the shallow; and this was
our employment two or three hours a-day, for
nineteen days together, during most part of
which the weather was so extremely cold, that
the ice hung to our cloaths, from the time we
were obliged to get in the water in the morning,
till we encamped at night. This was especially
disagreeable to me, as I had the courses
of the river to take for upwards of two hundred
and fifty miles.</p>

<p class='c011'>We kept on in this manner, without any
remarkable occurrence, till the 6th of December,
when our provisions falling short, I
went on shore, with the interpreter’s gun, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>shoot a turkey; singling one out, I pulled the
trigger, which missing fire, broke off the upper
chap and screw-pin; and, as I could find neither,
after several hours search, rendered the
gun unfit for service. M‘Cormack was not a
little chagrined at the loss of his gun; it indeed
greatly concerned us all; we had now
but one left, and that very indifferent; but
even this we were shortly to be deprived of, for
we were scarce a mile from this unlucky place,
when seeing a large bear coming down to the
water-side, Sumpter, to whom the remaining
gun belonged, took it to shoot; but not being
conveniently seated, he laid it on the edge of
the canoe, while he rose to fix himself to more
advantage; but the canoe giving a heel, let
the gun tumble over-board. It was irreparably
gone, for the water here was so deep, that
we could not touch the bottom with our longest
pole. We were now in despair: I even
deliberated whether it was not better to throw
ourselves over-board, as drowning at once seemed
preferable to a lingering death. Our provisions
were consumed to an ounce of meat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and but very little flour, our guns lost and
spoiled, ourselves in the heart of woods, at
a season when neither fruit nor roots were to be
found, many days journey from any habitation,
and frequented only by the northern Indians,
from whom we had more reason to expect
scalping than succour.</p>

<p class='c011'>We went ashore, as it was in vain to
proceed, and, desponding, began to make a fire;
while thus employed, several large bears came
down a steep hill towards us. This, at another
time, would have been a joyful sight; it now
only increased our affliction. They came
within the reach of a tommahawke; had we
had one, and the skill to throw it, we could
scarce have failed of killing. In short, they
were as daring as if they had been acquainted
with our misfortunes. Irritated by their boldness,
I formed several schemes for killing, among
which, as mending the broken gun
seemed most probable, I instantly set about
trying the experiment. Notching a flint on
each side, I bound it to the lower chap with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>leather thong. This succeeded so far, that in
ten or twelve times snapping, it might probably
fire, which was matter of great joy to us. Before
I had finished it, the bears were frightened away;
but as we had now mended our gun, we
conceived great hopes. It was very probable
they might return; and we were not long in
expectation, for in less than a quarter of an
hour, another very large one stalked down towards
us, tho’ not so near as the former ones
had done. M‘Cormack snatched up his gun,
and followed him near a quarter of a mile. I
had sat down in expectation of the event, and
pulled my shoes and stockings off to dry; when
I heard the report of the gun, my heart leaped
for joy, since I imagined M‘Cormack would
have certainly taken all imaginable precautions;
but judge of my despair, when, after running
myself out of breath, and bare-footed among
the rocks and briars, I found he had missed,
and that having left the ammunition at the
place where we had encamped, he could not
charge again, till I returned for it. I ran
back, unable as I was, and brought it; then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>sat down, and he continued the chace. By
this time Sumpter, who had been gathering
wood, joined me, and, we soon heard
M‘Cormack fire again; upon which, running
with all our speed, to the place from
whence the report came, we had the inexpressible
joy of seeing a large bear, that
might weigh near 400 weight, weltering in his
blood. It being late, we propped him for that
night, on an old tree, to prevent his being devoured
by other beasts. Next morning my
companions skinned him, and taking as much
of his meat as we could conveniently carry, we
left the camp in much better spirits than when
we came to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing more remarkable occurred, unless
I mark for such the amazing quantity of buffaloes,
bears, deer, beavers, geese, swans, ducks,
turkeys and other game, till we came to a large
cave; we stopped to examine it, but after climbing,
with great difficulty, near 50 feet almost
perpendicular, to get to it, we saw nothing curious,
except some pillars of the petrified droppings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>that fell from the roof, of a prodigious
size. I could not, indeed, penetrate very far,
for want of light. Coming back to the edge
of the rock, we perceived our canoe a-drift, going
down with the stream. Sumpter scrambled
down the rock, and, plunging into the river,
without giving himself scarce time to pull off
his coat, swam a quarter of a mile before he
could overtake her. When he returned, every
thing on him was stiff frozen. We instantly
made a fire to recover him; but this accident,
joined to the severity of the weather, obliged us
to stay the day and night following. We laid
ourselves down to sleep in the mouth of the
cave, where we had made our fire, which we
no sooner did, than, oppressed with the fatigues
of the preceding day, we fell into a sound sleep,
from which we were awaked before midnight,
by the howling of wild beasts in the cave,
who kept us awake with this concert till a
little before day. About four o’clock in the
morning, we had a more terrifying alarm, we
were stunned with a noise, like the splitting of
a rock. As there had never been, to all appearance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>a fire near that place, I could no otherwise
account for it, than by laying it to the fire,
which refining the air, might have occasioned
some pressure in the cavities, or fired some
collected vapour, the explosion of which had
been the noise that waked us; yet, as I could
not clearly comprehend it, I was under the
greatest apprehensions, especially as I could
perceive it hollow just under us. The severity,
however, of the weather obliged us to stay the
next night likewise, but the howling of the
beasts, and thinking of the preceding night’s
noise, prevented me from getting any sleep. On
the morning of the 9th instant, we were, to my
great satisfaction, obliged to decamp for want
of wood. We passed the place where the canoe
was taken up, and came to a fall about a
quarter of a mile further, which, had she
reached, we should never have seen the least
atom of her cargo more.</p>

<p class='c011'>We continued our journey much in the
same manner till the 11th: as during the
whole time we had seen or heard nothing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the northward Indians, the Cherokees had so
menaced us with, we began to imagine ourselves
secure, and that they had, for some reasons,
imposed on us, when the report of a gun
on one side of the river undeceived us; for as
the Cherokees had told us how much the
northward Indians frequented this place, it
was reasonable to conclude, that they themselves
came only here to fight, at which time
they seldom fire, as that gives notice to the
enemy where to come and reconnoitre them,
but seek to hear their adversaries fire, that their
scouts may measure their forces, and they take
all advantages of the enemy before they come
to action. We therefore concluded that this
must certainly be a party of northern hunters.
We were talking of this, when another gun
from the opposite shore declared us in the midst
of our enemies, whom there was no resisting;
we heard several more some time after, which
made us go as far as we possibly could before we
encamped, which we did very cautiously, retiring
into a thicket of canes, and chusing to lay on
our wet and cold blankets, rather than make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>fire to dry them, by which we might be discovered.
Next day we heard several more guns
on both sides of the river, which made us conjecture
that the Indians had watched us, but
not finding our encampment the night before,
were still following us. I was resolved, however,
to encamp in such an inconvenient manner
no more, and to make a fire at night,
whatever might be the consequence. We
took all other imaginable precautions, encamping
in a thicket of canes, impenetrable
to the eye, as we had done the preceding
night. About midnight some drops
falling on my face from the trees under
which we lay, awaked me, on which I
imagined I heard something walk round our
camp. I lay still some time to consider what
could be patroling at that time of night in the
rain, a thing unusual for wild beasts to do, when
M‘Cormack, who had been awake for some
time, asked me if I heard the noise. I told
him yes, very plain, for by the cracking of the
sticks that lay on the ground I could perceive
it approached us. M‘Cormack starting up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>swore directly it was a party of northern Indians,
and ran down, in a pannic, to the canoe,
and, had not I followed to prevent him, would
certainly have made off with it, and left us exposed
to the mercy of the enemy, if there were
any pursuing us, without any means of escape;
but for my part, I imagined it some half-starved
animal looking for food; and Sumpter
had been so certain of this, that he never
moved from where he lay; for when, in an
hour after, I had persuaded M‘Cormack to return
to the camp, we found Sumpter fast asleep,
and the noise entirely gone. We set out early
the next day, on account of this alarm, and about
12 o’clock heard a noise like distant thunder.
In half an hour we reached the place
called the Great Falls, from which it proceeded.
The river was here about half a mile broad,
and the water falling from one rock to another,
for the space of half a mile, had the appearance
of steps, in each of which, and all about the
rocks, the fish were sporting in prodigious
quantities, which we might have taken with
ease, had we not been too busy in working the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>canoe down, to look after them. I observed
here the same method I had with the other
falls, by going ashore and looking out the safest
way for the canoe to pass; and lest
some accident should happen to it, I took
what salt and ammunition we had left, and
carried it along the shore: if this was not so
dangerous, it was quite as difficult a task;
and were I to chuse again, I should prefer the
danger in the canoe to the difficulty of passing
such rocks, both hands occupied, with the care
of the gun and ammunition. Theirs was no
ways easy. Before they had passed half the
fall, the canoe ran fast on a rock, and it was
with the greatest difficulty they got her clear;
notwithstanding which I was at last so entangled
among the rocks, that I was obliged
to order the canoe ashore, at a place where
the current was more practicable than others,
and proceed in it. We scarce advanced a hundred
yards, when we ran with such violence
against another rock, that Sumpter, breaking
his pole in attempting to ward the shock, fell
over-board; and we narrowly escaped being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>partakers of the same accident. Had not the
canoe been of more than ordinary strength, she
must certainly have dashed to pieces; she
turned broadside too, shipping in a great deal
of water, by which all the things were wet
that I had so much laboured to preserve. We
got out to right her; and as I observed some
bad places below, I resolved to wade to the
shore, being as much an incumbrance as a
help. The water was not then above knee-deep;
but, before I reached the shore, I got
into a sluice as high as my arm-pits, and was
near forced away by the rapidity of the stream,
entangled in my surtout, and a blanket I had
wrapped about me: when I got on shore, examining
the damage I had sustained, I found
my watch and papers spoiled by the wet, and
myself almost frozen; so that, after shivering
on three miles further, we were constrained to
encamp, and make a fire to dry ourselves; but
as it continued snowing, hailing, and raining
alternately, we were again obliged to lie in
wet blankets; which, though more intolerable,
after the hardships we had sustained this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>day, we had done half the time since our
departure from the Great Island.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next morning, when we decamped, it was
so excessive cold, that coming to a still place
of the river, we found it frozen from bank to
bank, to such a degree, that almost the whole
day was spent in breaking the ice to make
a passage. This, indeed, had already happened
some days before, but never so severe as
now.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next morning we had the pleasure of finding
the ice entirely gone, thawed, probably, by a
hard rain that fell over-night, so that about
two o’clock we found ourselves in Broad River,
which being very high, we went the two following
days at the rate of ten miles an hour,
till we came within a mile of Tennessee river,
when, running under the shore, we on a sudden
discovered a party of ten or twelve Indians,
standing with their pieces presented on the
bank. Finding it impossible to resist or
escape, we ran the canoe ashore towards them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>thinking it more eligible to surrender immediately,
which might entitle us to better treatment,
than resist or fly, in either of which
death seemed inevitable, from their presented
guns, or their pursuit. We now imagined our
death, or, what was worse, a miserable captivity,
almost certain, when the headman of the party
agreeably surprised us, by asking, in the Cherokee
language, to what town we belonged? To
which our interpreter replied, To the English
camp; that the English and Cherokees having
made a peace, I was then carrying the articles
to their countrymen. On this the old warrior,
commonly called the Slave Catcher of Tennessee,
invited us to his camp, treated us with
dried venison, homminy, and boiled corn. He
told us that he had been hunting some time
thereabouts, and had only intended returning
in seven or eight days, but would now immediately
accompany us.</p>

<p class='c011'>We set out with them next morning to pursue
our voyage; but I was now obliged to give
over taking the courses of the river, lest the Indians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>who, tho’ very hospitable, are very suspicious
of things they cannot comprehend,
should take umbrage at it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Entering the Tennessee River, we began to
experience the difference between going with
the stream, and struggling against it; and between
easy paddles, and the long poles with
which we were constrained to slave, to keep
pace with the Indians, who would otherwise
have laughed at us. When we encamped about
ten miles up the river, my hands were so
galled, that the blood trickled from them, and
when we set out next morning I was scarce
able to handle a pole.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within four or five miles of the nation, the
Slave Catcher sent his wife forward by land,
partly to prepare a dinner, and partly to let me
have her place in his canoe, seeing me in pain,
and unaccustomed to such hard labour, which
seat I kept till about two o’clock, when we arrived
at his house, opposite the mouth of Tellequo
river, compleating a twenty-two days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>course of continual fatigues, hardships, and
anxieties.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our entertainment from these people was as
good as the country could afford, consisting of
roast, boiled, and fried meats of several kinds,
and very good Indian bread, baked in a very
curious manner. After making a fire on the
hearth-stone, about the size of a large dish,
they sweep the embers off, laying a loaf
smooth on it; this they cover with a sort of deep
dish, and renew the fire upon the whole, under
which the bread bakes to as great perfection
as in any European oven.</p>

<p class='c011'>We crossed the river next morning, with
some Indians that had been visiting in that
neigbourhood, and went to Tommotly, taking
Fort Loudoun in the way, to examine the
ruins.</p>

<p class='c011'>We were received at Tommotly in a very
kind manner by Ostenaco, the commander in
chief, who told me, he had already given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>me up for lost, as the gang I parted with at
the Great Island had returned about ten days
before, and that my servant was then actually
preparing for his return, with the news of my
death.</p>

<p class='c011'>After smoaking and talking some time, I delivered
a letter from Colonel Stephen, and another
from Captain M‘Neil, with some presents
from each, which were gratefully accepted by
Ostenaco and his consort. He gave me a general
invitation to his house, while I resided in
the country; and my companions found no
difficulty in getting the same entertainment, among
an hospitable, tho’ savage people, who
always pay a great regard to any one taken notice
of by their chiefs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some days after, the headmen of each town
were assembled in the town-house of Chote,
the metropolis of the country, to hear the articles
of peace read, whither the interpreter and
I accompanied Ostenaco.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The town-house, in which are transacted
all public business and diversions, is raised with
wood, and covered over with earth, and has
all the appearance of a small mountain at a
little distance. It is built in the form of a sugar
loaf, and large enough to contain 500 persons,
but extremely dark, having, besides the
door, which is so narrow that but one at a time
can pass, and that after much winding and
turning, but one small aperture to let the
smoak out, which is so ill contrived, that most
of it settles in the roof of the house. Within
it has the appearance of an ancient amphitheatre,
the seats being raised one above another,
leaving an area in the middle, in the center of
which stands the fire; the seats of the head
warriors are nearest it.</p>

<p class='c011'>They all seemed highly satisfied with the
articles. The peace-pipe was smoaked, and
Ostenaco made an harangue to the following
effect:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“The bloody tommahawke, so long lifted
against our brethren the English, must now
be buried deep, deep in the ground, never to
be raised again<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a>; and whoever shall act contrary
to any of these articles, must expect a
punishment equal to his offence<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Should a
strict observance of them be neglected, a war
must necessarily follow, and a second peace
may not be so easily obtained. I therefore
once more recommend to you, to take particular
care of your behaviour towards the
English, whom we must now look upon as
ourselves; they have the French and Spaniards
to fight, and we enough of our own colour,
without medling with either nation. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>desire likewise, that the white warrior, who
has ventured himself here with us, may be
well used and respected by all, wherever he
goes amongst us.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. As in this speech several allusions are made to the
customs of the Indians, it may not be impertinent to acquaint
the reader, that their way of declaring war, is by
smoaking a pipe as a bond among themselves, and lifting up
a hatchet stained in blood, as a menace to their enemies;
at declaring peace this hatchet is buried, and a pipe smoaked
by both parties, in token of friendship and reconciliation.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. The chiefs can inflict no punishment; but, upon the
signing of the peace, it was agreed by both nations, that offenders
on either side should be delivered up to be punished
by the offended party, and it is to this the Chief alludes.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The harangue being finished, several pipes
were presented me by the headsmen, to take a
whiff. This ceremony I could have waved, as
smoaking was always very disagreeable to me;
but as it was a token of their amity, and they
might be offended if I did not comply, I put
on the best face I was able, though I dared not
even wipe the end of the pipe that came out of
their mouths; which, considering their paint
and dirtiness, are not of the most ragoutant,
as the French term it.</p>

<p class='c011'>After smoaking, the eatables were produced,
consisting chiefly of wild meat; such as venison,
bear, and buffalo; tho’ I cannot much
commend their cookery, every thing being
greatly overdone: there were likewise potatoes,
pumpkins, homminy, boiled corn, beans,
and pease, served up in small flat baskets, made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of split canes, which were distributed amongst
the crowd; and water, which, except the spirituous
liquor brought by the Europeans, is
their only drink, was handed about in small
goards. What contributed greatly to render
this feast disgusting, was eating without knives
and forks, and being obliged to grope from
dish to dish in the dark. After the feast there
was a dance; but I was already so fatigued
with the ceremonies I had gone through, that
I retired to Kanagatucko’s hot-house<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a>; but
was prevented taking any repose by the smoke,
with which I was almost suffocated, and the
crowd of Indians that came and sat on the
bed-side; which indeed was not much calculated
for repose to any but Indians, or those
that had passed an apprenticeship to their ways,
as I had done: it was composed of a few
boards, spread with bear-skins, without any
other covering; the house being so hot, that I
could not endure the weight of my own blanket.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. This Hot-House is a little hut joined to the house, in
which a fire is continually kept, and the heat so great, that
cloaths are not to be borne the coldest day in winter.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Some hours after I got up to go away, but
met Ostenaco, followed by two or three Indians,
with an invitation from the headman
of Settico, to visit him the next day.</p>

<p class='c011'>I set out with Ostenaco and my interpreter
in the morning, and marched towards Settico,
till we were met by a messenger, about
half a mile from the town, who came to stop
us till every thing was prepared for our reception:
from this place I could take a view
of the town, where I observed two stand of
colours flying, one at the top, and the other
at the door of the town-house; they were as
large as a sheet, and white. Lest therefore I
should take them for French, they took great
care to inform me, that their custom was to
hoist red colours as an emblem of war; but
white, as a token of peace. By this time we
were joined by another messenger, who desired
us to move forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>About 100 yards from the town-house we
were received by a body of between three and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>four hundred Indians, ten or twelve of which
were entirely naked, except a piece of cloth
about their middle, and painted all over in a
hideous manner, six of them with eagles tails
in their hands, which they shook and flourished
as they advanced, danced in a very uncommon
figure, singing in concert with some
drums of their own make, and those of the
late unfortunate Capt. Damere; with several
other instruments, uncouth beyond description.
Cheulah, the headman of the town, led the
procession, painted blood-red, except his face,
which was half black, holding an old rusty
broad-sword in his right hand, and an eagle’s
tail in his left. As they approached, Cheulah,
singling himself out from the rest, cut two or
three capers, as a signal to the other eagle-tails,
who instantly followed his example.
This violent exercise, accompanied by the
band of music, and a loud yell from the
mob, lasted about a minute, when the headman
waving his sword over my head, struck
it into the ground, about two inches from
my left foot; then directing himself to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>me, made a short discourse (which my interpreter
told me was only to bid me a hearty
welcome) and presented me with a string of
beads. We then proceeded to the door, where
Cheulah, and one of the beloved men, taking
me by each arm, led me in, and seated
me in one of the first seats; it was so dark
that nothing was perceptible till a fresh supply
of canes were brought, which being burnt in
the middle of the house answers both purposes
of fuel and candle. I then discovered about
five hundred faces; and Cheulah addressing
me a second time, made a speech much
to the same effect as the former, congratulating
me on my safe arrival thro’ the numerous parties
of the northern Indians, that generally haunt
the way I came. He then made some professions
of friendship, concluding with giving me
another string of beads, as a token of it.
He had scarce finished, when four of those
who had exhibited at the procession made their
second appearance, painted milk-white, their
eagle-tails in one hand, and small goards with
beads in them in the other, which they rattled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>in time to the music. During this dance
the peace-pipe was prepared; the bowl of it
was of red stone, curiously cut with a knife,
it being very soft, tho’ extremely pretty when
polished. Some of these are of black stone,
and some of the same earth they make their
pots with, but beautifully diversified. The
stem is about three feet long, finely adorned
with porcupine quills, dyed feathers, deers
hair, and such like gaudy trifles.</p>

<p class='c011'>After I had performed my part with this,
I was almost suffocated with the pipes presented
me on every hand, which I dared not to
decline. They might amount to about 170 or
180; which made me so sick, that I could not
stir for several hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Indians entertained me with another
dance, at which I was detained till about seven
o’clock next morning, when I was conducted
to the house of Chucatah, then second in command,
to take some refreshment. Here I
found a white woman, named Mary Hughes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>who told me she had been prisoner there near
a twelvemonth, and that there still remained among
the Indians near thirty white prisoners
more, in a very miserable condition for want of
cloaths, the winter being particularly severe;
and their misery was not a little heightened by
the usage they received from the Indians. I
ordered her to come to me to Ostenaco’s, with
her miserable companions, where I would distribute
some shirts and blankets I had brought
with me amongst them, which she did some
days after.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a short nap, I arose and went to the
town-house, where I found the chiefs in consultation;
after some time, I was called upon,
and desired to write a letter for them to the
Governor of South Carolina, which signified
their desire of living in peace with the English,
as long as the sun shone, or grass grew, and
desired that a trade might be opened between
them. These wrote, I sealed them up, with
some wampum and beads in the inside. I
was the same day invited to Chilhowey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>where I was received and treated much in the
same manner as at Settico. I wrote some letters;
and one that Yachtino the headman had
brought from Col. Stephen was interpreted
to them, which seemed to give them great satisfaction.
I found here a white man, who,
notwithstanding the war, lived many years
among them; he told me that the lower
towns had been greatly distressed when attacked
by Colonel Montgomery; being
obliged to live many months upon horse-flesh,
and roots out of the woods, occasioned partly
by the numbers drove among them, and the
badness of the crops that year.</p>

<p class='c011'>Returning home with Ostenaco the next
day, being the 2d of January 1762, I enquired
whether he thought I should receive
any more invitations? He told me he believed
not, because the towns to which I had already
been invited, having been our most inveterate
enemies during the war, had done this, as an
acknowledgment and reparation of their fault.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>I had now leisure to complete taking the
courses of the river, from which, as I have
already mentioned, I was deterred by the Indians,
as likewise to make remarks upon the
country and inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c011'>The country being situated between thirty-two
and thirty-four degrees north latitude, and
eighty-seven degrees thirty minutes west longitude
from London, as near as can be calculated,
is temperate, inclining to heat during
the summer-season, and so remarkably fertile,
that the women alone do all the laborious
tasks of agriculture, the soil requiring only a
little stirring with a hoe, to produce whatever is
required of it; yielding vast quantities of
pease, beans, potatoes, cabbages, Indian corn,
pumpions, melons, and tobacco, not to mention
a number of other vegetables imported
from Europe, not so generally known amongst
them, which flourish as much, or more here,
than in their native climate; and, by the daily
experience of the goodness of the soil, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>may conclude, that, with due care, all European
plants might succeed in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the arrival of the Europeans, the
natives were not so well provided, maize, melons,
and tobacco, being the only things they
bestow culture upon, and perhaps seldom on
the latter. The meadows or savannahs produce
excellent grass; being watered by abundance
of fine rivers, and brooks well stored
with fish, otters and beavers, having as yet
no nets, the Indians catch the fish with lines,
spears, or dams; which last, as it seems particular
to the natives of America, I shall
trouble the reader with a description of. Building
two walls obliquely down the river from
either shore, just as they are near joining, a
passage is left to a deep well or reservoir; the
Indians then scaring the fish down the river,
close the mouth of the reservoir with a large
bush, or bundle made on purpose, and it is no
difficult matter to take them with baskets,
when enclosed within so small a compass.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>North America, being one continual forest,
admits of no scarcity of timber for every use:
there are oaks of several sorts, birch, ash,
pines, and a number of other trees, many of
which are unknown in Europe, but already
described by many authors. The woods likewise
abound with fruits and flowers, to which
the Indians pay little regard. Of the fruits
there are some of an excellent flavour, particularly
several sorts of grapes, which, with proper
culture, would probably afford an excellent
wine. There are likewise plumbs, cherries,
and berries of several kinds, something
different from those of Europe; but their
peaches and pears grow only by culture: add
to these several kinds of roots, and medicinal
plants, particularly the plant so esteemed by
the Chinese, and by them called gingsang, and
a root which never fails curing the most inveterate
venereal disease, which, however, they
never had occasion for, for that distemper, before
the arrival of Europeans among them.
There are likewise an incredible number of
buffaloes, bears, deer, panthers, wolves, foxes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>racoons, and opossums. The buffaloes, and
most of the rest, have been so often described,
and are so well known, that a description of
them would be but tedious; the opossum,
however, deserves some attention, as I have
never seen it properly described. It is about
the size of a large cat, short and thick, and of a
silver colour. It brings forth its young, contrary
to all other animals, at the teat, from
whence, when of a certain size, and able to
walk, it drops off, and goes into a false belly,
designed by providence in its dam for its reception,
which, at the approach of danger,
will, notwithstanding this additional load,
climb rocks and trees with great agility for
its security.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are a vast number of lesser sort of
game, such as rabbits, squirrels of several sorts,
and many other animals, beside turkeys,
geese, ducks of several kinds, partridges, pheasants,
and an infinity of other birds, pursued
only by the children, who, at eight or ten
years old, are very expert at killing with a sarbacan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>or hollow cane, through which they
blow a small dart, whose weakness obliges
them to shoot at the eye of the larger sort of
prey, which they seldom miss.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are likewise a great number of reptiles,
particularly the copper-snake, whose bite
is very difficult to cure, and the rattle-snake,
once the terror of Europeans, now no longer
apprehended, the bite being so easily cured;
but neither this, nor any other species, will attempt
biting unless disturbed or trod upon;
neither are there any animals in America mischievous
unless attacked. The flesh of the
rattle-snake is extremely good; being once
obliged to eat one through want of provisions,
I have eat several since thro’ choice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of insects, the flying stag is almost the only
one worthy of notice; it is about the shape of
a beetle, but has very large beautiful branching
horns, like those of a stag, from whence it
took its name.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The Indians have now a numerous breed of
horses, as also hogs, and other of our animals,
but neither cows nor sheep; both these, however,
might be supplied by breeding some tame
buffaloes, from which, I have been informed,
some white prisoners among them have procured
both butter and cheese; and the fine
long shag on its back could supply all the purposes
of wool.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mountains contain very rich mines
of gold, silver, lead, and copper, as may be evinced
by several accidentally found out by the
Indians, and the lumps of valuable ore washed
down by several of the streams, a bag of which
sold in Virginia at a considerable price; and
by the many salt springs, it is probable there
are many mines of that likewise, as well as of
other minerals. The fountains too may have
many virtues, that require more skilful persons
than the Cherokees or myself to find out.</p>

<p class='c011'>They have many beautiful stones of different
colours, many of which, I am apt to believe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>are of great value; but their superstition
has always prevented their disposing of them
to the traders, who have made many attempts
to that purpose; but as they use them in their
conjuring ceremonies, they believe their parting
with them, or bringing them from home,
would prejudice their health or affairs. Among
others, there is one in the possession of
a conjurer, remarkable for its brilliancy and
beauty, but more so for the extraordinary
manner in which it was found. It grew, if
we may credit the Indians, on the head of a
monstrous serpent, whose retreat was, by its
brilliancy, discovered; but a great number of
snakes attending him, he being, as I suppose
by his diadem, of a superior rank among the
serpents, made it dangerous to attack him.
Many were the attempts made by the Indians,
but all frustrated, till a fellow, more bold than
the rest, casing himself in leather, impenetrable
to the bite of the serpent or his guards, and
watching a convenient opportunity, surprised
and killed him, tearing this jewel from his head,
which the conjurer has kept hid for many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>years, in some place unknown to all but two
women, who have been offered large presents
to betray it, but steadily refused, lest some
signal judgment or mischance should follow.
That such a stone exists, I believe, having seen
many of great beauty; but I cannot think it
would answer all the encomiums the Indians
bestow upon it. The conjurer, I suppose,
hatched the account of its discovery; I have
however given it to the reader, as a specimen
of an Indian story, many of which are much
more surprising.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cherokees are of a middle stature, of
an olive colour, tho’ generally painted, and
their skins stained with gun-powder, pricked
into it in very pretty figures. The hair of
their head is shaved, tho’ many of the old
people have it plucked out by the roots, except
a patch on the hinder part of the head, about
twice the bigness of a crown-piece, which
is ornamented with beads, feathers, wampum,
stained deers hair, and such like baubles. The
ears are slit and stretched to an enormous size,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>putting the person who undergoes the operation
to incredible pain, being unable to lie on either
side for near forty days. To remedy this, they
generally slit but one at a time; so soon as the
patient can bear it, they are wound round with
wire to expand them, and are adorned with silver
pendants and rings, which they likewise wear
at the nose. This custom does not belong originally
to the Cherokees, but taken by them
from the Shawnese, or other northern nations.</p>

<p class='c011'>They that can afford it wear a collar of
wampum, which are beads cut out of clamshells,
a silver breast-plate, and bracelets on
their arms and wrists of the same metal, a bit
of cloth over their private parts, a shirt of the
English make, a sort of cloth-boots, and
mockasons, which are shoes of a make peculiar
to the Americans, ornamented with porcupine-quills;
a large mantle or match-coat
thrown over all compleats their dress at home;
but when they go to war they leave their
trinkets behind, and the mere necessaries serve
them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The women wear the hair of their head,
which is so long that it generally reaches to
the middle of their legs, and sometimes to the
ground, club’d, and ornamented with ribbons
of various colours; but, except their eyebrows,
pluck it from all the other parts of
the body, especially the looser part of the sex.
The rest of their dress is now become very
much like the European; and, indeed, that of
the men is greatly altered. The old people still
remember and praise the ancient days, before
they were acquainted with the whites, when
they had but little dress, except a bit of skin
about their middles, mockasons, a mantle of
buffalo skin for the winter, and a lighter one
of feathers for the summer. The women,
particularly the half-breed, are remarkably
well featured; and both men and
women are straight and well-built, with small
hands and feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The warlike arms used by the Cherokees
are guns, bows and arrows, darts, scalpping-knives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>and tommahawkes, which are
hatchets; the hammer-part of which being
made hollow, and a small hole running from
thence along the shank, terminated by a small
brass-tube for the mouth, makes a compleat
pipe. There are various ways of making these,
according to the country or fancy of the purchaser,
being all made by the Europeans;
some have a long spear at top, and some different
conveniencies on each side. This is one
of their most useful pieces of field-furniture,
serving all the offices of hatchet, pipe, and
sword; neither are the Indians less expert at
throwing it than using it near, but will kill at
a considerable distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>They are of a very gentle and amicable disposition
to those they think their friends, but
as implacable in their enmity, their revenge
being only compleated in the entire destruction
of their enemies. They were pretty hospitable
to all white strangers, till the Europeans
encouraged them to scalp; but the great reward
offered has led them often since to commit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>as great barbarities on us, as they formerly
only treated their most inveterate enemies
with. They are very hardy, bearing heat,
cold, hunger and thirst, in a surprizing manner;
and yet no people are given to more excess
in eating and drinking, when it is conveniently
in their power: the follies, nay mischief,
they commit when inebriated, are entirely
laid to the liquor; and no one will revenge
any injury (murder excepted) received
from one who is no more himself: they are
not less addicted to gaming than drinking, and
will even lose the shirt off their back, rather
than give over play, when luck runs against
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>They are extremely proud, despising the lower
class of Europeans; and in some athletick
diversions I once was present at, they refused
to match or hold conference with any but
officers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, however, the vulgar notion of the
Indians uncommon activity was contradicted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>by three officers of the Virginia regiment, the
slowest of which could outrun the swiftest
of about 700 Indians that were in the place:
but had the race exceeded two or three hundred
yards, the Indians would then have acquired
the advantage, by being able to keep the same
pace a long time together; and running being
likewise more general among them, a body of
them would always greatly exceed an equal
number of our troops.</p>

<p class='c011'>They are particularly careful of the superannuated,
but are not so till of a great age;
of which Ostenaco’s mother is an instance.
Ostenaco is about sixty years of age, and the
youngest of four; yet his mother still continues
her laborious tasks, and has yet strength
enough to carry 200 weight of wood on her
back near a couple of miles. I am apt to
think some of them, by their own computation,
are near 150 years old.</p>

<p class='c011'>They have many of them a good uncultivated
genius, are fond of speaking well, as that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>paves the way to power in their councils; and
I doubt not but the reader will find some
beauties in the harangues I have given him,
which I assure him are entirely genuine. Their
language is not unpleasant, but vastly aspirated,
and the accents so many and various, you
would often imagine them singing in their
common discourse. As the ideas of the Cherokees
are so few, I cannot say much for the
copiousness of their language.</p>

<p class='c011'>They seldom turn their eyes on the person
they speak of, or address themselves to, and
are always suspicious when people’s eyes are
fixed upon them. They speak so low, except
in council, that they are often obliged to
repeat what they were saying; yet should a
person talk to any of them above their common
pitch, they would immediately ask him,
if he thought they were deaf?</p>

<p class='c011'>They have likewise a sort of loose poetry, as
the war-songs, love-songs, &amp;c. Of the latter
many contain no more than that the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>man loves the young woman, and will be uneasy,
according to their own expression, if he
does not obtain her. Of the former I shall present
the following specimen, without the original
in Cherokee, on account of the expletive
syllables, merely introduced for the music, and
not the sense, just like the toldederols of many
old English songs.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. It is the custom of the Indians, to leave a club, something
of the form of a cricket-bat, but with their warlike
exploits engraved on it, in their enemy’s country, and the
enemy accepts the defiance, by bringing this back to their
country.</p>

women, at the party’s return, to revenge the death of those
that have perished by the wretch’s countrymen. This
savage custom has been so much mitigated of late, that the
prisoners were only compelled to marry, and then generally
allowed all the privileges of the natives. This lenity,
however, has been a detriment to the nation; for many of
these returning to their countrymen, have made them acquainted
with the country-passes, weakness, and haunts of
the Cherokees; besides that it gave the enemy greater courage
to fight against them.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. Their custom is generally to engrave their victory on
some neighbouring tree, or set up some token of it near
the field of battle; to this their enemies are here supposed
to point to, as boasting their victory over them, and the
slaughter that they made.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Both the ideas and verse are very loose in
the original, and they are set to as loose a music,
many composing both tunes and song off
hand, according to the occasion; tho’ some
tunes, especially those taken from the northern
Indians, are extremely pretty, and very like
the Scotch.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Indians being all soldiers, mechanism
can make but little progress; besides this,
they labour under the disadvantage of having
neither proper tools, or persons to teach the use
of those they have: Thus, for want of saws,
they are obliged to cut a large tree on each
side, with great labour, to make a very clumsy
board; whereas a pair of sawyers would divide
the same tree into eight or ten in much
less time: considering this disadvantage, their
modern houses are tolerably well built. A
number of thick posts is fixed in the ground,
according to the plan and dimensions of the
house, which rarely exceeds sixteen feet in
breadth, on account of the roofing, but often
extend to sixty or seventy in length, beside the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>little hot-house. Between each of these posts is
placed a smaller one, and the whole wattled
with twigs like a basket, which is then covered
with clay very smooth, and sometimes
white-washed. Instead of tiles, they cover
them with narrow boards. Some of these
houses are two story high, tolerably pretty
and capacious; but most of them very inconvenient
for want of chimneys, a small hole
being all the vent assigned in many for the
smoak to get out at.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their canoes are the next work of any
consequence; they are generally made of a
large pine or poplar, from thirty to forty feet
long, and about two broad, with flat bottoms
and sides, and both ends alike; the Indians
hollow them now with the tools they get from
the Europeans, but formerly did it by fire:
they are capable of carrying about fifteen or
twenty men, are very light, and can by the
Indians, so great is their skill in managing
them, be forced up a very strong current, particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the bark canoes; but these are seldom
used but by the northern Indians.</p>

<p class='c011'>They have of late many tools among them,
and, with a little instruction, would soon become
proficients in the use of them, being
great imitators of any thing they see done;
and the curious manner in which they dress
skins, point arrows, make earthen vessels,
and basket-work, are proofs of their ingenuity,
possessing them a long time before the
arrival of Europeans among them. Their
method of pointing arrows is as follows:
Cutting a bit of thin brass, copper, bone, or
scales of a particular fish, into a point with
two beards, or some into an acute triangle,
they split a little of their arrow, which is generally
of reeds; into this they put the point,
winding some deers sinew round the arrow,
and through a little hole they make in the
head; then they moisten the sinew with their
spittle, which, when dry, remains fast glewed,
nor ever untwists. Their bows are of several
sorts of wood, dipped in bears oil, and seasoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>before the fire, and a twisted bear’s gut for the
string.</p>

<p class='c011'>They have two sorts of clay, red and white,
with both which they make excellent vessels,
some of which will stand the greatest heat.
They have now learnt to sew, and the men
as well as women, excepting shirts, make all
their own cloaths; the women, likewise, make
very pretty belts, and collars of beads and
wampum, also belts and garters of worsted.
In arts, however, as in war, they are greatly
excelled by their northern neighbours.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their chief trade is with those Europeans
with whom they are in alliance, in hides, furs,
&amp;c. which they barter by the pound, for all other
goods; by that means supplying the deficiency
of money. But no proportion is kept to their
value; what cost two shillings in England,
and what cost two pence, are often sold for
the same price; besides that, no attention is
paid to the goodness, and a knife of the best
temper and workmanship will only sell for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>same price as an ordinary one. The reason of
this is, that, in the beginning of the commerce,
the Indians finding themselves greatly imposed
upon, fixed a price on each article, according to
their own judgment; powder, balls, and several
other goods, are by this means set so low,
that few people would bring them, but that
the Indians refuse to trade with any person
who has not brought a proportionable quantity,
and the traders are cautious of losing a trade
in which 5 or 600 per cent. in many articles
fully recompences their loss in these.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to religion, every one is at liberty to
think for himself; whence flows a diversity of
opinions amongst those that do think, but the
major part do not give themselves that trouble.
They generally concur, however, in the
belief of one superior Being, who made them,
and governs all things, and are therefore never
discontent at any misfortune, because they
say, the Man above would have it so. They
believe in a reward and punishment, as may
be evinced by their answer to Mr. Martin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>who, having preached scripture till both his
audience and he were heartily tired, was told
at last, that they knew very well, that, if they
were good, they should go up, if bad, down;
that he could tell no more; that he had long
plagued them with what they no ways understood,
and that they desired him to depart the
country. This, probably, was at the instigation
of their conjurers, to whom these people pay
a profound regard; as christianity was entirely
opposite, and would soon dispossess the people
of their implicit belief in their juggling art,
which the professors have brought to so great
perfection as to deceive Europeans, much
more an ignorant race, whose ideas will naturally
augment the extraordinary of any thing
the least above their comprehension, or out of
the common tract. After this I need not say
that in every particular they are extremely superstitious,
that and ignorance going always
hand in hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>They have few religious ceremonies, or
stated times of general worship: the green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>corn dance seems to be the principal, which
is, as I have been told, performed in a very
solemn manner, in a large square before the
town-house door: the motion here is very
slow, and the song in which they offer thanks
to God for the corn he has sent them, far
from unpleasing. There is no kind of rites
or ceremonies at marriage, courtship and all
being, as I have already observed, concluded
in half an hour, without any other celebration,
and it is as little binding as ceremonious;
for though many last till death, especially
when there are children, it is common for a
person to change three or four times a-year.
Notwithstanding this, the Indian women gave
lately a proof of fidelity, not to be equalled
by politer ladies, bound by all the sacred ties
of marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of the soldiers in the garrison of
Fort Loudoun, having Indian wives, these
brought them a daily supply of provisions,
though blocked up, in order to be starved to
a surrender, by their own countrymen; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>they persisted in this, notwithstanding the express
orders of Willinawaw, who, sensible of
the retardment this occasioned, threatened
death to those who would assist their enemy;
but they laughing at his threats, boldly told
him, they would succour their husbands every
day, and were sure, that, if he killed them,
their relations would make his death atone
for theirs. Willinawaw was too sensible of
this to put his threats into execution, so that
the garrison subsisted a long time on the provisions
brought to them in this manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they part, the children go with, and
are provided for, by the mother. As soon as
a child is born, which is generally without
help, it is dipped into cold water and washed,
which is repeated every morning for two
years afterward, by which the children acquire
such strength, that no ricketty or deformed
are found amongst them. When the woman
recovers, which is at latest in three days, she
carries it herself to the river to wash it; but
though three days is the longest time of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>illness, a great number of them are not so
many hours; nay, I have known a woman
delivered at the side of a river, wash her child,
and come home with it in one hand, and a
goard full of water in the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>They seldom bury their dead, but throw
them into the river; yet if any white man
will bury them, he is generally rewarded with
a blanket, besides what he takes from the
corpse, the dead having commonly their guns,
tommahawkes, powder, lead, silver ware,
wampum, and a little tobacco, buried with
them; and as the persons who brings the corpse
to the place of burial, immediately leave it, he
is at liberty to dispose of all as he pleases, but
must take care never to be found out, as nothing
belonging to the dead is to be kept, but
every thing at his decease destroyed, except
these articles, which are destined to accompany
him to the other world. It is reckoned,
therefore, the worst of thefts; yet there is no
punishment for this, or any other crime, murder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>excepted, which is more properly revenged
than punished.</p>

<p class='c011'>This custom was probably introduced to
prevent avarice, and, by preventing hereditary
acquisitions, make merit the sole means of acquiring
power, honour, and riches. The inventor,
however, had too great a knowledge
of the human mind, and our propensity to possess,
not to see that a superior passion must intercede;
he therefore wisely made it a religious
ceremony, that superstition, the strongest passion
of the ignorant, might check avarice, and
keep it in the bounds he had prescribed. It
is not known from whence it came, but it is
of great antiquity, and not only general over
all North America, but in many parts of Asia.
On this account the wives generally have separate
property, that no inconveniency may arise
from death or separation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Indians have a particular method of relieving
the poor, which I shall rank among
the most laudable of their religious ceremonies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>most of the rest consisting purely in the vain
ceremonies, and superstitious romances of their
conjurers. When any of their people are
hungry, as they term it, or in distress, orders
are issued out by the headmen for a war-dance,
at which all the fighting men and warriors assemble;
but here, contrary to all their other
dances, one only dances at a time, who, after
hopping and capering for near a minute, with
a tommahawke in his hand, gives a small hoop,
at which signal the music stops till he relates
the manner of taking his first scalp, and concludes
his narration, by throwing on a large
skin spread for that purpose, a string of wampum,
piece of plate, wire, paint, lead, or any
thing he can most conveniently spare; after
which the music strikes up, and he proceeds
in the same manner through all his warlike
actions: then another takes his place, and the
ceremony lasts till all the warriors and fighting
men have related their exploits. The
stock thus raised, after paying the musicians,
is divided among the poor. The same ceremony
is made use of to recompence any extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>merit. This is touching vanity in
a tender part, and is an admirable method of
making even imperfections conduce to the
good of society.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their government, if I may call it government,
which has neither laws or power to support
it, is a mixed aristocracy and democracy,
the chiefs being chose according to their merit
in war, or policy at home; these lead the warriors
that chuse to go, for there is no laws or
compulsion on those that refuse to follow, or
punishment to those that forsake their chief:
he strives, therefore, to inspire them with a
sort of enthusiasm, by the war-song, as the
ancient bards did once in Britain. These
chiefs, or headmen, likewise compose the assemblies
of the nation, into which the war-women
are admitted. The reader will not be
a little surprised to find the story of Amazons
not so great a fable as we imagined, many of
the Indian women being as famous in war, as
powerful in the council.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The rest of the people are divided into two
military classes, warriors and fighting men,
which last are the plebeians, who have not
distinguished themselves enough to be admitted
into the rank of warriors. There are some
other honorary titles among them, conferred
in reward of great actions; the first of which
is Outacity, or Man-killer; and the second
Colona, or the Raven. Old warriors likewise,
or war-women, who can no longer go to war,
but have distinguished themselves in their
younger days, have the title of Beloved. This
is the only title females can enjoy; but it abundantly
recompences them, by the power they
acquire by it, which is so great, that they can,
by the wave of a swan’s wing, deliver a wretch
condemned by the council, and already tied to
the stake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their common names are given them by
their parents; but this they can either change,
or take another when they think proper; so
that some of them have near half a dozen,
which the English generally increase, by giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>an English one, from some circumstance in their
lives or disposition, as the Little Carpenter to
Attakullakulla, from his excelling in building
houses; Judd’s friend, or corruptly the Judge,
to Ostenaco, for saving a man of that name
from the fury of his countrymen; or sometimes
a translation of his Cherokee name, as
Pigeon to Woey, that being the signification
of the word. The Over-hill settlement is by
these two chiefs divided into two factions, between
whom there is often great animosity,
and the two leaders are sure to oppose one another
in every measure taken. Attakullakulla
has done but little in war to recommend him,
but has often signalized himself by his policy,
and negotiations at home. Ostenaco has a tolerable
share of both; but policy and art are
the greatest steps to power. Attakullakulla
has a large faction with this alone, while
Oconnestoto, sir-named the Great Warrior, famous
for having, in all his expeditions, taken
such prudent measures as never to have
lost a man, has not so much power, and
Ostenaco could never have obtained the superiority,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>if he had not a great reputation in
both.</p>

<p class='c011'>On my arrival in the Cherokee country, I
found the nation much attached to the French,
who have the prudence, by familiar politeness,
(which costs but little, and often does a great
deal) and conforming themselves to their ways
and temper, to conciliate the inclinations of almost
all the Indians they are acquainted with,
while the pride of our officers often disgusts
them; nay, they did not scruple to own to me,
that it was the trade alone that induced them
to make peace with us, and not any preference
to the French, whom they loved a great deal
better. As however they might expect to
hasten the opening of the trade by telling me
this, I should have paid but little regard to it,
had not my own observations confirmed me,
that it was not only their general opinion, but
the policy of most of their headmen; except
Attakullakulla, who conserves his attachment
inviolably to the English.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>I shall be accused, perhaps, for mentioning
policy among so barbarous a nation; but tho’
I own their views are not so clear and refined
as those of European statesmen, their alliance
with the French seems equal, proportioning
the lights of savages and Europeans, to our
most masterly strokes of policy; and yet we
cannot be surprised at it, when we consider
that merit alone creates their ministers, and
not the prejudices of party, which often create
ours.</p>

<p class='c011'>The English are now so nigh, and encroached
daily so far upon them, that they not
only felt the bad effects of it in their hunting
grounds, which were spoiled, but had all the
reason in the world to apprehend being swallowed
up, by so potent neighbours, or driven
from the country, inhabited by their fathers, in
which they were born, and brought up, in
fine, their native soil, for which all men have a
particular tenderness and affection. The
French lay farther off, and were not so powerful;
from them, therefore, they had less to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>fear. The keeping these foreigners then more
upon a footing, as a check upon one another,
was providing for their own safety, and that of
all America, since they foresaw, or the French
took care to shew them, that, should they be
driven out, the English would in time extend
themselves over all North America. The
Indians cannot, from the woods of America,
see the true state of Europe: report is all they
have to judge by, and that often comes from
persons too interested to give a just account.
France’s circumstances were not in such a
flourishing condition as was represented; the
French were conquered, and a war carried into
the heart of the Cherokee country; many of
their towns were sacked and plundered without
a possibility of relieving them, as they lay
straggled on a large extent of ground, many
miles from one another; it was then their interest,
or rather they were compelled, to ask for
peace and trade, without which they could
no longer flourish.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Were arts introduced, and the Cherokees
contracted into a fortified settlement, governed
by laws, and remoter from the English, they
might become formidable; but hunting must
be then laid more aside, and tame cattle supply
the deficiency of the wild, as the greater the
number of hunters, the more prey would be
required; and the more a place is haunted by
men, the less it is resorted to by game. Means
might be taken, would the Cherokees follow
them, to render the nation considerable; but
who would seek to live by labour, who can
live by amusement? The sole occupations of
an Indian life, are hunting, and warring
abroad, and lazying at home. Want is said to
be the mother of industry, but their wants are
supplied at an easier rate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some days after my reception at Chilhowey,
I had an opportunity of seeing some more of
their diversions. Two letters I received from
some officers at the Great Island occasioned a
great assembly at Chote, where I was conducted
to read them; but the Indians finding nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>that regarded them, the greater part
resolved to amuse themselves at a game they
call nettecawaw; which I can give no other
description of, than that each player having
a pole about ten feet long, with several
marks or divisions, one of them bowls a round
stone, with one flat side, and the other convex,
on which the players all dart their poles after
it, and the nearest counts according to the
vicinity of the bowl to the marks on his pole.</p>

<p class='c011'>As I was informed there was to be a physic-dance
at night, curiosity led me to the town-house,
to see the preparation. A vessel of their
own make, that might contain twenty gallons
(there being a great many to take the medicine)
was set on the fire, round which stood
several goards filled with river-water, which
was poured into the pot; this done, there
arose one of the beloved women, who, opening
a deer-skin filled with various roots and herbs,
took out a small handful of something like fine
salt; part of which she threw on the headman’s
seat, and part into the fire close to the pot; she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>then took out the wing of a swan, and after
flourishing it over the pot, stood fixed for near
a minute, muttering something to herself; then
taking a shrub-like laurel (which I supposed
was the physic) she threw it into the pot,
and returned to her former seat. As no more
ceremony seemed to be going forward, I took
a walk till the Indians assembled to take it.
At my return I found the house quite full:
they danced near an hour round the pot, till
one of them, with a small goard that might
hold about a gill, took some of the physic, and
drank it, after which all the rest took in
turn. One of their headmen presented me
with some, and in a manner compelled me
to drink, though I would have willingly
declined. It was however much more palatable
than I expected, having a strong taste
of sassafras: the Indian who presented it, told
me it was taken to wash away their sins; so
that this is a spiritual medicine, and might be
ranked among their religious ceremonies.
They are very solicitous about its success; the
conjurer, for several mornings before it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>drank, makes a dreadful howling, yelling,
and hallowing, from the top of the town-house,
to frighten away apparitions and evil
spirits. According to our ideas of evil spirits,
such hideous noises would by sympathy
call up such horrible beings; but I am apt
to think with the Indians, that such noises are
sufficient to frighten any being away but themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was almost every night at some dance, or
diversion; the war-dance, however, gave me
the greatest satisfaction, as in that I had an opportunity
of learning their methods of war, and
a history of their warlike actions, many of
which are both amusing and instructive.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was not a little pleased likewise with their
ball-plays (in which they shew great dexterity)
especially when the women played, who
pulled one another about, to the no small
amusement of an European spectator.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>They are likewise very dexterous at pantomime
dances; several of which I have seen performed
that were very diverting. In one of
these, two men, dressed in bear-skins, came in,
stalking and pawing about with all the motions
of real bears: two hunters followed them, who
in dumb shew acted in all respects as they would
do in the wood: after many attempts to shoot
them, the hunters fire; one of the bears is
killed, and the other wounded; but, as they
attempt to cut his throat, he rises up again, and
the scuffle between the huntsmen and the
wounded bear generally affords the company a
great deal of diversion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The taking the pigeons at roost was another
that pleased me exceedingly; and these, with
my walking and observations, furnished me
with amusement for some time; but the season
not always permitting my going abroad, and
as I had so little to do at home, I soon grew
tired of the country. The Indian senate indeed
would sometimes employ me in reading and
writing letters for them; of which I generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>acquitted myself to their satisfaction, by adding
what I thought would be acceptable, and
retrenching whatever might displease.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 17th, a party came home from hunting
on Holston’s River, bringing with them an
eagle’s tail, which was celebrated at night by
a grand war-dance, and the person who killed
it had the second war-title of Colona conferred
upon him, besides the bounty gathered at the
war-dance, in wampum, skins, &amp;c. to the
amount of thirty pounds; the tail of an eagle
being held in the greatest esteem, as they sometimes
are given with the wampum in their
treaties, and none of their warlike ceremonies
can be performed without them.</p>

<p class='c011'>This Indian acquainted the headman of a
current report in the English camp, that a large
body of English were to march next spring
through the Cherokees country, against the
French. There was little probability or possibility
in such a report, yet it was received
with some degree of belief; every thing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>news, every flying rumour, is swallowed here
by the populace. The least probability is exaggerated
into a fact, and an Indian from our
camp, who scarce understands four or five
words of a conversation between two common
soldiers, who often know as little of
the state of affairs as the Indians themselves,
turn all the rest of it to something he suspects,
and imagines he has heard what was never once
mentioned; and this, when he returns to his
own country, is passed about as a certainty.
From hence flows the continual mistakes the
Indians unavoidably make in their councils;
they must act according to intelligence, and it
requires a great penetration indeed to discern the
truth, when blended with so much falsity:
thus they are often obliged to act according
to the report of a mistaken or lying Indian,
who are all but too much addicted to this
vice, which proved a continual fund of uneasiness
to me all the time I remained in their
country.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>On the 26th of January, advices were received
from the Great Island, that some Cherokees
had been killed by the northern Indians,
who had been encouraged, and much caressed,
by the commanding officer. This piece of
news seemed greatly to displease them; they
suspended however their judgment, till further
intelligence. I began to be very uneasy
for the return of an express I had sent out
on my arrival, who was to come back by the
Great Island, and was the only person who could
give me any accounts I could rely on, as I was
sensible the Indian one was infinitely exaggerated.
We were yet talking of this, when the
<em>News Hallow</em> was given from the top of Tommotly
town-house; whereupon Ostenaco rose
from the table, and went immediately to the
town-house, where he staid till day. On asking
him next morning, What news? he seemed
very unwilling to tell me, and went out of
the house, seemingly very much displeased. I
then made the same question to several other
Indians, whose different stories convinced me it
was something they endeavoured to conceal.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>I was under some apprehension at this unusual
incivility. It was no wonder I was alarmed;
had the English given any encouragement
to these northern ravagers, nay, had the French
faction persuaded their countrymen of our countenancing
them in the slaughter, the meanest of
the deceased’s relations had it in his power to
sacrifice me to their manes, and would certainly
have done it, since, in default of kindred,
their revenge falls on any of the same country
that unfortunately comes within their reach;
and nothing could be a protection to an hostage,
when capitulating could not save the garrison of
Fort Loudoun: a body of Indians pursued
them, and breaking through the articles, and
all the laws of war and humanity, surprised
and butchered them. Disguising, however,
my uneasiness, I seemingly took to some diversions,
while I sent M‘Cormack to pry into the
true cause of such a change; he following my
host, found no difficulty in shuffling amongst
the crowd into the town-house, where Ostenaco
made the following speech.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“We have had some bad talks lately from
the Great Island, which I hope nevertheless
are not true, as I should be very sorry that
the peace, so lately concluded with our brethren
the English, should be broke in so
short a time: we must not judge as yet of
what we have heard from the Great Island.
If Bench the express does not return soon, I
myself will raise a party, and go to the Great
Island, where I shall get certain information
of all that has happened.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This speech was received with shouts of applause,
and the assembly betook themselves to
dancing.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 28th, I was invited to a grand eagle’s
tail dance, at which about 600 persons of both
sexes were assembled. About midnight, in
the heat of their diversion, news was brought
of the death of one of their principal men,
killed at the Great Island by the northern Indians.
This put a sudden stop to their diversion,
and nothing was heard but threats of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>vengeance. I easily concluded that this could
only proceed from the confirmation of the
ill news already received. I tried as much as
laid in my power to mollify their anger, by telling
them, that, if any accident had happened
to their people, it was neither by consent or approbation
of the English; that tho’ the northern
Indians were our allies as well as they, I
was certain more favour would be shewn them
than their enemies, as Capt. M‘Neil, who commanded
the fort, was a good, humane, brave
officer, and had always shewn so much friendship
for their nation, as to leave no room to
doubt of his protection to any of their people who
should be under his care. This satisfied them
so well, that some proposed dancing again; but
as it was late, they agreed to give over their
diversion for that night.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 4th of February, an account came
in almost contradictory to this. An Indian
woman from Holston’s River was the messenger,
who related, that the northern Indians
had turned their arms against the English, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>were then actually building a breast-work
within a quarter of a mile of Fort Robinson;
that, whilst one half were employed in carrying
on the work, the other observed the motions
of our people; but this lie was even too gross
for Indians to digest; tho’ the next day, another
who came in confirmed it, and moreover
affirmed the enemy’s fortifications to be already
breast high.</p>

<p class='c011'>The 15th was the day appointed for the return
of the Little Carpenter; and his not arriving
began to give his friends a great deal of uneasiness.
Ostenaco bore likewise his share in it,
as his brother was of the party. Here is a lesson
to Europe; two Indian chiefs, whom we
call barbarians, rivals of power, heads of two
opposite factions, warm in opposing one another,
as their interest continually clash; yet these
have no farther animosity, no family-quarrels
or resentment, and the brother of the chief
who had gained the superiority is a volunteer
under his rival’s command.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>For my part, I was no less anxious about the
express. I dispatched my servant out to meet
him, and bring me the particulars of what had
been transacted at the Great Island; he returned
in about five or six days, with the letters the
express had been charged with, leaving him to
make out the rest of the journey as his fatigue
would permit. Among others was a letter
from Capt. M‘Neil, informing me, that a party
of about seventy northern Indians came to
Fort Robinson a short time after I had left it,
who told him, that they came from Pittsburg,
with a pass from the commanding officer, to
join us against the Cherokees, not knowing that
we had already concluded a peace. They
seemed very much dissatisfied at coming so far
to no purpose, and demanded if any Cherokees
were near? They were answered, that a party
were out a hunting; but, if they would be
looked upon as friends to the English, they must
not meddle with them, while under the protection
of the commanding officer. The Indians,
however, paying but little regard to this
admonition, went immediately in pursuit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>them, and finding them a few hours after, as
in no apprehension of any enemy, they fired
on them before they discovered themselves,
killing one, and wounding another, who
however made his escape to the fort. His
countrymen all did the same, without returning
the fire, as few of their guns were loaded,
and they inferior in number. Their enemies
pursued them to the fort, but could never see
them after, as Capt. M‘Neil took great care to
keep them asunder. Finding therefore no
more likelihood of scalping, the northern Indians
marched away from the fort.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the same party I encamped with
the first night after my departure from the
Great Island, and were surprised at the same
place, where they had still continued.</p>

<p class='c011'>He farther informed me, that I should probably
find Fort Robinson, and all the posts on
the communication, evacuated, as the regiment
was to be broke.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>I made this letter public, with which they
seemed tolerably well satisfied, particularly
when I feigned the wounded Indian was under
the care of an English surgeon, who would not
fail to cure him in a little time.</p>

<p class='c011'>I now began to be very desirous of returning,
and acquainted Ostenaco of my anxiety,
desiring him to appoint fifteen or twenty headmen,
agreeable to the orders I had received
from Col. Stephen, as likewise to collect all
the white persons and negroes, to be sent conformable
to the articles of peace, to Fort
Prince George. He replied, that, as soon as
the white prisoners returned from hunting,
where they then were with their masters (the
white people becoming slaves, and the property
of those that take them) he would set about
the performance. Some time after this, when
all the prisoners were come in, I again attacked
Ostenaco; but then his horses could not be
found, and there was a necessity of having one
or two to carry my baggage and his own. I
then waited till the horses were found; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>I supposed all things ready for our departure,
I was greatly surprised to find it delayed. Ostenaco
told me, that one of the Carpenter’s party,
which was on its return home, had come in
the night before, and reported, that the Carolinians
had renewed the war before they had
well concluded a peace. The Indian had, according
to custom, a long account of it; but
tho’ I shewed the improbability of such a story,
Ostenaco refused to set out before the Carpenter
arrived, which was not till the 23d following.
He brought in the same report, but
owned he did not believe it, as it was told him
by a person who he thought wanted to raise
some disturbance.</p>

<p class='c011'>I now began to be very pressing with Ostenaco,
threatening if he would not set out immediately,
to return without him. This however
would have been my last resource, as I
was for the space of 140 miles ignorant of every
step of the way. I at last prevailed on him;
but on the 10th of March, while we were
again preparing for our departure, the <em>Death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Hallow</em> was heard from the top of Tommotly
town-house. This was to give notice of the
return of a party commanded by Willinawaw,
who went to war towards the Shawnese country
some time after my arrival. After so many
disappointments, I began to think I should never
get away, as I supposed this affair would
keep me, as others had done, two or three
days, and till some new accident should intervene
to detain me longer. About eleven o’clock
the Indians, about forty in number, appeared
within sight of the town; as they approached,
I observed four scalps, painted red on the fleshside,
hanging on a pole, and carried in front of
the line, by the second in command, while Willinawaw
brought up the rear. When near the
town-house, the whole marched round it three
times, singing the war-song, and at intervals
giving the <em>Death Hallow</em>; after which, sticking
the pole just by the door, for the crowd to
gaze on, they went in to relate in what manner
they had gained them. Curiosity prompted me
to follow them into the town-house; where,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>after smoaking a quarter of an hour in silence,
the chief gave the following account of their
campaign.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After we left Tommotly, which was about
the middle of January, we travelled near
400 miles before we saw the least sign of the
enemy; at last, one evening, near the river
Ohio, we heard the report of several guns,
whereupon I sent out several scouts to discover
who they were, and if possible where they
encamped, that we might attack them early
next morning; about dark the scouts returned,
and informed us they were a party of Shawnese,
hunting buffaloes; that they had
watched them to the river-side, where, taking
to their canoes, they had paddled across the
river; and seeing a great many fires on the
other side, where our scouts directed our
sight, we concluded it to be a large encampment;
we thereupon began to consult, whether
it would be more adviseable to cross the
river over night, or early next morning: it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>decided in favour of the former, notwithstanding
its snowing excessively hard, lest we
should be discovered. We accordingly stripped
ourselves, tying our guns to our backs,
with the buts upwards, to which we hung
our ammunition, to prevent its getting wet;
we then took water, and swam near half a
mile to the other side, where we huddled together
to keep ourselves warm, intending
to pass the remainder of the night in that
manner, and to fall on the enemy at daybreak;
but as it continued snowing the whole
time, it proved so cold, that we could endure
it no longer than a little past midnight, when
we resolved to surround the enemy’s camp,
giving the first fire, and, without charging
again, run on them with our tommahawkes,
which we had tucked in our belts for that purpose,
should there be occasion. We accordingly
surrounded them; but when the signal
was given for firing, scarce one fourth of
our guns went off, wet with the snow, notwithstanding
all the precautions we had taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to preserve them dry: we then rushed
in; but, before we came to a close engagement,
the enemy returned our fire; as, it was
at random, not being able to see us before we
were upon them, on account of the darkness
of the night, and the thickness of the bushes,
we received no damage. They had not time
to charge again, but fought us with the buts
of their guns, tommahawkes, and firebrands.
In the beginning of the battle we took two
prisoners, who were continually calling out to
their countrymen to fight strong, and they
would soon conquer us; this made them
fight much bolder, till the persons who had
the prisoners in custody put a stop to it, by
sinking a tommahawke in each of their skulls,
on which their countrymen took to flight,
and left every thing behind them. As soon
as it was day, we examined the field, where
we found two more of the enemy dead, one
of which was a French warrior, which, with
the prisoners we had killed, are the four
scalps we have brought in. We lost only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>one man, the poor brave Raven of Togua,
who ran rashly before us in the midst of the
enemy. We took what things we could
conveniently bring with us, and destroyed the
rest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having finished his account of the expedition,
out of his shot-pouch he pulled a piece
of paper, wrapped up in a bit of birch-bark,
which he had taken out of the Frenchman’s
pocket, and gave it to me to look at, asking
if I did not think it was his commission? I replied
in the negative, telling him it was only
some private marks of his own, which I did not
understand. It appears to me to have been his
journal, every seventh line being longer than the
others, to denote the Sunday; the death’s head,
and other marks, relate to what happened on
the several days; but having filled his paper long
before his death, he had supplied it by interlining
with a pin. These are my conjectures,
I have however annexed it here from the original,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>still in my possession, that each reader
may make his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>About one o’clock the baggage and all things
being ready, Ostenaco took leave of his friends,
tho’ this ceremony is unusual among them, and
we began our march sooner than I expected.
Passing thro’ Toqua, we saw several Indians
weeping for the death of their relations, killed
in the late battle. In an hour’s time we arrived
at Chote, where we found a great number of
headmen assembled to give us a talk, containing
instructions to my Indian conductors, to remind
the English of their promises of friendship,
and to press the Governor of Virginia to
open a trade; for the Indians to behave well to
the inhabitants when they arrived, as that was the
only way to keep the chain of friendship bright;
that we should keep a good look-out, as the enemy
were very numerous on the path. What
occasioned this precaution, and probably Ostenaco’s
delaying his departure so long, was, the
defeat of a party of about thirty Indians, who
went cut to war some time before, the same way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>that we were to go, eight of whom had been
killed or taken. They attributed this loss to the
want of arrows, the northern Indians having
poured several vollies of arrows, and done great
execution, before the Cherokees could charge
again, after the first fire. This was especially
disadvantageous to the Cherokees, as both parties
met unexpectedly on the top of a mountain,
which they were both crossing, and engaged
so close, that the northern Indians availed
themselves of this advantage, and the superiority
of their numbers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two pieces of cannon were fired when we
had got about 200 yards from the town-house,
after which Ostenaco sung the war-song, in
which was a prayer for our safety thro’ the intended
journey; this he bellowed out loud
enough to be heard at a mile’s distance. We
did not march above three miles before we encamped,
in order to give time to some Indians
who were to accompany us, but had not yet
joined us, which they did in the evening, about
fourteen or fifteen in number. Next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>morning, the 11th of March, we rose tolerably
early, marching to Little River, about twenty
miles from the nation, where we encamped.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this place had formerly been an Indian
town, called Elajoy; and I am surprised how
the natives should ever abandon so beautiful and
fertile a spot. Were it in a more polished
country, it would make the finest situation for a
gentleman’s seat I ever saw.</p>

<p class='c011'>We marched the next day to Broad River,
which we crossed about four o’clock in the afternoon,
without much difficulty, by reason of
the lowness of the waters; but the river, which
is here 700 yards over, runs with great rapidity,
and the banks extremely steep on either
side. We encamped directly, and were all
employed in making a large fire to dry ourselves,
as most of us had got very wet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before sun-set I perceived a considerable
number of Indians passing at the same place,
whom I at first imagined to be enemies; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>arrival of some of them shewed them to be
Cherokees, who kept continually dropping in,
so that I was greatly surprised next morning at
their numbers. I demanded where they were
going? to which they replied, To Virginia;
that the headmen had thought proper to send
a reinforcement, thinking it unsafe for so small
a body to march through a country so much
frequented by the enemy, where, if I met with
any accident, the blame would fall upon them.
I thanked them; but at the same time told
them peremptorily to go back, and give themselves
no further trouble on my account;
that I had no occasion for them; and that it
would be impossible for so large a body to subsist
when passed the hunting grounds, as the
people on the frontiers of Virginia had been so
impoverished by the late war, they would not
be able to supply us with provisions. This
made no impression on them, and they marched,
on without saying another word, and persisted
in going, notwithstanding all the efforts Osteco
and I could make to prevent them. Indeed
I was more earnest to have them return, as I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>found it was the scent of presents, more than the
desire of escorting me, that was the real motive
of all this good-will.</p>

<p class='c011'>We left the camp the next day, about 165
in number, and marched without any extraordinary
occurrence till the 15th, about mid-day,
when we heard our scouts on the left (for we
always kept on both flanks) fire pretty quick
after one another, and in less than a minute
seventeen or eighteen buffaloes ran in amongst
us, before we discovered them, so that several of
us had like to have been run over, especially the
women, who with some difficulty sheltered
themselves behind the trees. Most of the men
fired, but, firing at random, one only was killed,
tho’ several more wounded. Our scouts likewise
killed another, and brought in the best
parts of the meat, all which was cooked over-night
for our departure next morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>After passing a very disagreeable night on account
of the rain, which, as the evening had been
clear, I had taken no precaution to shelter myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>self against. We had as disagreeable a march, it
proved very rainy, and were again obliged to
encamp to a great disadvantage for the convenience
of good water.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 17th, about two o’clock in the afternoon,
we met an Indian who left the Great
Island some time after me, with a party of ten or
twelve, destined to Williamsburg, who, after he
had eat, drank, and smoaked, told us the party
that he belonged to had been attacked two days
before; that two of them had been killed,
two or three taken, and the rest dispersed;
that he had reason to believe there were a great
many of the enemy upon the path, as he had
seen a great many tracks and other signs.</p>

<p class='c011'>On this intelligence, Ostenaco ordered all his
men to fresh prime their guns, and those that
had bows and arrows to put them in readiness,
sending out some scouts, and desiring all to keep
a good look-out. After these dispositions we
parted with the fugitive Indian, and continued
our route. At night our scouts came in, and informed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>formed us, that they had seen some old tracks,
and a piece of an old red waistcoat, dropped by
the enemy, to inform us they were thereabouts.
We made large fires to dry ourselves, while
Ostenaco, and four or five others, took out and
waved their eagles tails, then turning towards
the place where the tracks had been discovered,
gave the war-hoop several times extremely loud.
This was to let the enemy know, if within hearing,
and disposed for an engagement, where he
and his party lay. This however Ostenaco probably
would not have done, had he not confided
in the number of his party, being greatly superior
to what commonly go to make war on one another.
Before the Indians went to sleep, he
gave them a strong caution, and instructions
how to act in case they were attacked.</p>

<p class='c011'>We decamped pretty early next morning, in
order, if possible, to reach the Great island that
day; but the scouts had not been out an hour before
some returned with an account of fresh tracks
and other signs of the enemy. I really expected
a skirmish with the northern Indians, as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>might probably imagine some Cherokees would
return with me when I left their country; and
it was probable the party I had received an account
of, and had given so many checks to the
Cherokees since, were still waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we marched very slow, on account of receiving
intelligence from our scouts, which they
brought in every two or three hours, we encamped
short of the Great Island about seven or
eight miles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning we were in no great hurry
to decamp, as we intended to go no farther
than the Great Island that day. By this retardment
each man had time to put his arms in
proper order. We set out about eleven o’clock,
and, after four or five miles march, Ostenaco desired
me to go before, to see if any of the enemy
were there. The northern Indians being at
peace with us, was urged as a sufficient protection,
tho’, at setting out, they seemed a little apprehensive
of my falling into such desperadoes
hands, or rather of their losing their share of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>presents. I was to tell the enemy, if I met
them, that the Cherokees were but few in
number, and but indifferently armed; after
which Sumpter and I were furnished with
horses, and went forward pretty briskly, till we
reached Holston’s River, the crossing place of
which was within a mile of Fort Robinson.
We had not forded above half-way over, when
we heard the report of a gun, which made us
conclude that our suspicions of the enemy’s being
there were but too justly grounded; we rode
gently towards the fort to make our observations;
but no enemy appearing, on entering the clear
ground about the fort, and perceiving some
smoak from one of the chimnies, we rode within
an hundred yards of it, and hallowed, but
nobody appearing, we went to the gate, and
gave another hoop, which, to my great surprise,
instead of the enemy, brought a white
man out of one of the houses, whom I immediately
recollected to be M’Lamore the interpreter,
that accompanied the discomfited party
of Cherokees, I lately mentioned, to Virginia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and he was soon followed by the man who had
fired the gun.</p>

<p class='c011'>I returned to the party, highly satisfied at my
good fortune, in not being obliged to displease
the Indians, by breaking thro’ so disagreeable
and dangerous a commission, who had already
crossed the river when I joined them.</p>

<p class='c011'>We found in the fort eleven or twelve
hundred weight of flour, left by the garrison
when they evacuated the place, which abundantly
recompensed the Indians for all their
fatigues.</p>

<p class='c011'>We remained here all next day to rest ourselves,
and mend our mockasons, tho’ such fine
weather was scarce to be lost, considering the
very bad we had experienced most of the way
from the Cherokee country; this made me extremely
anxious to be going forward, but the
Indians seldom hurry themselves when they
were to leave such good cheer, after having passed
most of the way without bread. I was informed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>by M’Lamore, that the flour had been
left for want of horses to carry it away, as well
as the goods I had observed in one of the storehouses,
belonging to a private trader; that the
northern Indians, after defeating the small party
to which he belonged, and taking him and
two more prisoners, came to the fort, where,
notwithstanding our alliance with them, they
destroyed a great quantity of the flour and
goods, and carried a great quantity more away,
as well as the man that had the care of them;
but that, after some days march, all the prisoners
found means to make their escape: that
they two returned to the fort, one proposing to
wait my coming, and return with me to Virginia,
and M’Lamore to go back to the Cherokee
country.</p>

<p class='c011'>I next day intreated Ostenaco to order his
men to get ready for the march, as the weather
was fine, and it would be agreeable travelling;
but notwithstanding all he or I could say, not a
man of them would stir; their excuse was, that
one of their horses was lost, and the owner out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>in search of him. We waited his return till
night, when he came, but no horse was to be
found. I was very much mortified at this accident,
as I was anxious to know what was become
of my camp-equipage, cloaths, &amp;c. I
had left at Fort Attakullakulla.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 22d, we rose early in the morning,
to make a good day’s march, but the horse was
not found till near twelve o’clock: I then
thought our immediate departure certain, but
was again disappointed; the person who had
the care of the goods, missing a piece of broad-cloth,
charged the Indians with the theft, and
a general search was made to no purpose.
Ostenaco then ordered all within the fort,
while he and the conjuror went into the house
from whence it was stole, to beg the devil’s advice
about recovering it. The conjuror might
perhaps have saved himself that trouble, for
tho’ I am at a loss to guess in what manner, I
am inclined to believe he had as great a hand
in the loss as in the recovery of it. I desired
him to trouble himself no farther about it, chusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>rather to pay for it, than be detained any
longer; but all I could say could not divert him
from his conjuring, which however furnished
me with a few more of their oddities.</p>

<p class='c011'>After staying some time, the conjuror sallied
out blindfolded, and groped about, till he came
to the skirts of the woods, where, pulling off the
blind, he went straight forwards, a considerable
way, and returned in about five minutes with
the broad-cloth on his shoulders. I observed
his cheek tied up with a bit of twine, which,
when untied, bled very much. I gave the conjuror
two yards as a reward for playing the fool,
and we marched forward, encamping about
ten miles from the fort.</p>

<p class='c011'>We called in our way at Fort Attakullakulla,
which was likewise evacuated, looked for my
cloaths, &amp;c. but they were all stolen and carried
off by the soldiers, except a small trunk,
with a few trifles, I found afterwards at New
River.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Some time after, we met Capt. Israel Christian
going with a cargo of goods, to trade
in the Cherokee country. I here endeavoured
to send back the greatest part of the Indians;
but notwithstanding all the persuasions the
Captain and I could make use of, not a man of
them would return, till the Captain promised
the same presents to those that would go back,
as would be given to those that went forward,
not doubting but that he would be reimbursed,
as the charge of victualling of them would be
entirely saved; but as this expence fell entirely
upon me, as will appear in the sequel, it was
rather taking the burthen off me than off the
public. I am heartily sorry, however, this gentleman
has suffered, as well as myself, for his
good intentions, and more so, that it is not in my
power to discharge the public debt, and reimburse
him. But even by this we could only reduce
our number to about seventy-two.</p>

<p class='c011'>We called at Fort Lewis, where we found
William Shorey the interpreter, who, by order
of Col. Stephen, had waited our coming, to accompany
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the Indians to Williamsburg. I received
here between seventy and eighty pounds
that was due to me, which came very opportunely
to defray our expences to Williamsburg;
where we arrived in about eleven days after our
departure from Fort Lewis.</p>

<p class='c011'>On my arrival, I waited on the Governor,
who seemed somewhat displeased with the
number of Indians that had forced themselves
upon me. Orders however were issued out
for their accommodation, and a few days after a
council was called, at which Ostenaco, and some
of the principal Indians, attended. After the
usual ceremonies, and mutual promises of
friendship, the Indians were dismissed, and presents
ordered them, to the amount of 125<em>l.</em> currency;
12<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> for Ostenaco, the same sum
to be sent back to King Kanagatucko, and the
rest to be divided among the party, who seemed
much displeased when it came to be divided,
being, as they said, like nothing among them.
I was apprehensive of some bad consequence
should they return dissatisfied, and therefore advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>pretty considerably out of my own
pocket to content them.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few days before they were to depart for
their own country, Mr. Horrocks invited Ostenaco
and myself to sup with him at the College,
where, amongst other curiosities, he
shewed him the picture of his present Majesty.
The chief viewed it a long time with particular
attention; then turning to me, “Long,” said
he, “have I wished to see the king my father;
this is his resemblance, but I am determined
to see himself; I am now near the sea, and
never will depart from it till I have obtained
my desires.” He asked the Governor next
day, who, tho’ he at first refused, on Ostenaco’s
insisting so strongly upon it, gave his
consent. He then desired, as I had been with
him so long, that I might accompany him to
England: this I was to do at my own expence;
but the Governor told me he would recommend
me to the minister of state, which he did in as
strong terms as I could desire.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>I was then upon the point of entering into a
very advantageous commerce, which I quitted to
please the Indians, and preserve them ours, yet
wavering to the French interest. I prepared every
thing necessary for my voyage; but this was
not my only expence, the Indians having no
money, expect the person who travels with
them to treat them with whatever they take a
fancy to.</p>

<p class='c011'>We set out for Hampton about the beginning
of May, where we were to embark; but
contrary winds, and other delays, retarded us
till the 15th, during which time it generally
cost me between 15 and 20<i>s.</i> per day.</p>

<p class='c011'>We had very fine weather during the whole
voyage, yet both the Indians and myself were
sea-sick all the way. We parted with a convoy
we had under our care off Newfoundland,
in a very thick fog, notwithstanding all the efforts
Capt. Blake could make, by ringing bells,
and firing every quarter of an hour, to keep
them together, tho’ I afterwards heard him severely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>accused in England of taking this opportunity
to leave his charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>We had the misfortune here to lose the interpreter
Shorey, who was much regretted by
us all, but especially by the Indians, as he was a
thorough master of their language. He had
lingered some time in a consumption, caught in
passing a small river, for, being drunk, his Indian
spouse plunged him in to sober him, but
was unable to draw him out, and had not some
Indians come to her assistance he must have
been drowned. This was an effectual means
of sobering him, but by it he contracted the
malady that carried him off.</p>

<p class='c011'>During our voyage the Indians conceived
very advantageous ideas of our naval force; the
Captain having chased and brought too about
sixteen sail, found them all to be English or
neutral vessels, on which the Cherokees concluded
the French and Spaniards were certainly
afraid to put to sea.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>On the 16th of June we arrived at Plymouth,
where, before we went on shore, the
Indians had their desire of seeing a large man
of war gratified, by being carried on board the
Revenge, a seventy-four gun ship, with which
they were equally pleased and surprised.</p>

<p class='c011'>While in the boat that took us to shore,
Ostenaco, painted in a very frightful manner,
sung a solemn dirge with a very loud voice, to
return God thanks for his safe arrival. The
loudness and uncouthness of his singing, and
the oddity of his person, drew a vast crowd of
boats, filled with spectators, from all the ships
in the harbour; and the landing-place was so
thronged, that it was almost impossible to get to
the inn, where we took post for London.</p>

<p class='c011'>We stopped at Exeter, where the Indians were
shewed the cathedral, but, contrary to my expectation,
were as little struck as if they had
been natives of the place. They were much
better pleased the next day with Lord Pembroke’s
seat at Wilton, till they saw the statue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of Hercules with his club uplifted, which they
thought so dreadful that they begged immediately
to be gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>We arrived the next day in London, without
any other accident than the breaking down
of the chaise in which the Indians were, but
happily none of them were hurt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Blake waited on Lord Egremont, to
acquaint him with our arrival. We were immediately
sent for, and, after some few questions,
dismissed. Lodgings were ordered, and
taken by Mr. N—— Caccanthropos. We
were again sent for by Lord Egremont, but
more to gratify the curiosity of some of his
friends than about business. I however took
this opportunity of flipping my letter of recommendation
into his Lordship’s hands, which he
read, and assured me he would shew it to the
King that day; telling me to let the Indians or
myself want for nothing; that as I was a perfect
stranger, he had ordered Mr. Caccanthropos
to provide whatever we desired.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>My first care was to equip the Indians. I
attended Mr. Caccanthropos, to order all after
the mode of their own country.</p>

<p class='c011'>As several days passed before I had any further
orders, the Indians became extremely anxious
to see the King. “What is the reason,”
said they, “that we are not admitted to see the
Great King our Father, after coming so far for
that purpose?” I was obliged to reply, “That
his Majesty was indisposed, and could not
be waited on till perfectly recovered,” which
in some measure pacified them. We were
taken not long after to court; but I was only
asked a few questions, of which I gave the interpretation
to the Indians that might be most
favourably received.</p>

<p class='c011'>The uncommon appearance of the Cherokees
began to draw after them great crowds of
people of all ranks; at which they were so
much displeased, that home became irksome to
them, and they were forever teizing me to take
them to some public diversion. Their favourite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>was Sadler’s-Wells; the activity of the
performers, and the machinery of the pantomime,
agreeing best with their notions of diversion.
They were likewise very fond of Ranelagh,
which, from its form, they compared
to their town-house; but they were better pleased
with Vauxhall, tho’ it was always against
my inclination I accompanied them there, on account
of the ungovernable curiosity of the people,
who often intruded on them, and induced
them to drink more than sufficient. Once, in
particular, one of the young Indians got extremely
intoxicated, and committed several irregularities,
that ought rather to be attributed
to those that enticed them, than to the simple
Indians, who drank only to please them. I
cannot indeed cite sobriety as their characteristic;
but this I can say, these excesses never
happened at home. A bottle of wine, a bowl
of punch, and a little cyder, being the ordinary
consumption of the three Indians, Sumpter,
and myself; and as we were seldom at home,
it could not put the nation to a great expence.
If the bills given in for these articles were to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the greatest degree excessive, let them that
charged them answer who consumed them;
I only know that no more was ever drank by us.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was not the only thing laid to my
charge; I was accused of receiving money for
admission to see the Indians. The sheep was
accused by the wolf of rapine, who carried his
point. He was a thorough-paced under-courtier;
the sheep, a raw Virginian, who, ignorant
of little arts, innocently believed others as honest
as himself, and could never believe such
impudence existed, as to accuse another of
crimes his conscience assured him he was sole
actor of. I was so prepossessed with these opinions,
that I can scarce as yet, however severely
I have felt it, believe that some men
have no ideas of conscience, and esteem it the
prejudices of education, and a narrow mind;
and that blasting an innocent person’s character,
whenever it answered their ends, or that robbing
the nation was no crime, when they could
escape punishment.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>It was a long time before I knew any thing
of these money-taking works. The following
accident was what brought it to light. Finding
myself entirely confined by the continual
crowds of visitors, I resolved to lessen the number,
by ordering the servants to admit none but
people of fashion. This was what would have
been at once agreeable to the Indians, and raised
their ideas of the English nation. So far
from these orders being complied with, the
whole rabble of the town was ushered in the
next day. Not a little mortified, I complained
to Lord Egremont, who, already perhaps prepossessed
against me, only told me coldly, that he
would speak of it to Mr. Caccanthropos. At
my return, tho’ I found the house full of people,
I said nothing more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some days after, Sumpter, who had contracted
some genteel acquaintance, some of whom he
was bringing to see the Indians, was stopped by
the servant, Mr. Caccanthropos’s relation, who
refused to admit them without money. The
young man, who had faced all dangers for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>service of his country in the war, who had
been so highly instrumental in saving us from
the dangers that threatened us in going to their
country, and had accompanied us ever since,
received that affront from an insolent servant;
but not being able to bear the insult, he took a
warrior’s satisfaction, and knocked him down.
A blunt Virginian soldier cannot know the laws
of England, as little can he bear an insult from
so mean a quarter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The servant informed his kinsman, who came
next day open-mouthed, threatening Sumpter
with the crown-office. He next gave me such
scurrilous language, that I was perfectly at a loss
how to retort it adequately; I had subject
enough, but being accustomed to gentlemen’s
company, I could scarce understand his dialect:
piqued, however, at the stinging truths I told
him, he threatened me with confinement also,
assaying to intimidate me from publishing them,
by reminding me that he was a justice of the
peace. Happily I reflected on the disparity of
his years and strength to mine; my hands had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>near disgraced me, by striking a person I so much
every way despised. He dared not, however, put
his threats into execution; his only vengeance for
affronting me, was ordering the people of the
house to feed us for the future on ox-cheek,
cow-heel, and such like dainties, fit entertainment
for Indians accustomed to only the
choicest parts of the beast, and very fit to raise
their opinion of England. I however understanding
Lord Egremont’s orders in a different
light, took care to provide whatever was requisite
for the Indians, avoiding at the same time
all appearance of extravagance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sumpter’s company were not the only persons
to whom admittance was refused; the same
servant had even the impudence to stop Lady
T-r—l-y. Her Ladyship sent immediately for
Mrs. Quin, the gentlewoman of the house, to
enquire if I encouraged the servants in taking
money for seeing the Indians. Mrs. Quin set her
Ladyship to rights in that particular; but still
whatever exactions these fellows made, the public
generally laid to me. I was cleared, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>by Cacanthropos himself, who once attempted
to stop Mr. Montague; and his fear and
confusion on finding whom he had offended,
in some measure revenged me.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon after these disturbances, orders were
given by Lord Egremont, that no person whatever
should be admitted, without an order from
himself, or Mr. Wood, under Secretary of State:
but instead of the throngs decreasing by this
order, it rather increased; and I really believe
few persons have more friends than Mr. Wood,
if he knew but half of those that were ushered
in under that name; nay, grown bolder by that
sanction, they pressed into the Indians dressing
room, which gave them the highest disgust, these
people having a particular aversion to being
stared at while dressing or eating; on which last
occasion, if I was irksome myself, judge what a
crowd of strangers must be. They were so disgusted,
that they grew extremely shy of being
seen, so that I had the greatest difficulty in procuring
Lord C—t—f—d a sight of them; on
which, being a little angry, I was afterwards informed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>his Lordship had been offended at
something I am yet a stranger to. It ever was
against my inclination to give offence to even
the lowest class of mankind, much less to Lord
C—t—f—d.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was not only, however, accused of receiving
money at our lodgings, but at the public
places we frequented. To this I answer, so far
from making by them, it generally cost me
pretty considerable to the servants, besides coach-hire;
for tho’ one was allowed us, we could
command it no oftener than Mr. Cacanthropos
was pleased to do us that favour; and this expence
was entirely out of my own pocket,
without any prospect of reimbursement.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the charge laid against me, the proprietors
are still alive, and any person that entertains
the smallest doubt, may, and would oblige
me, by enquiring of themselves, whether I ever
demanded or took directly or indirectly any
money or consideration whatever from them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>But let us now return to the Indians. Some
time before they left England, they were admitted
to a conference with his Majesty at St.
James’s. Ostenaco’s speech on that occasion
contained nothing more than protestations of
friendship, faithful alliance, &amp;c. To which an
answer was afterwards given in writing, to
be interpreted in their own country, as I was
not conversant enough in their language to
translate it; though I understood whatever they
said, especially the speech, which I gave
word for word to his Majesty, as Shorey had
likewise explained it before his death, except
the last part, which was so much in my favour
that I was obliged to suppress it, and was in
some confusion in finding wherewith to supply
it; till I at last told his Majesty, that it was only
in some manner a repetition of the first part
of his discourse.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were struck with the youth, person,
and grandeur of his Majesty, and conceived as
great an opinion of his affability as of his
power, the greatness of which may be seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>on my telling them in what manner to behave;
for finding Ostenaco preparing his pipe
to smoak with his Majesty, according to the
Indian custom of declaring friendship, I told
him he must neither offer to shake hands or
smoak with the King, as it was an honour for
the greatest of our nation to kiss his hand.
You are in the right, says he, for he commands
over all next to the Man above, and
nobody is his equal. Their ideas were likewise
greatly increased by the number of ships
in the river, and the warren at Woolwich,
which I did not fail to set out to the greatest
advantage, intimating that our Sovereign had
many such ports and arsenals round the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some days before the Indians set out on
their return to their own country, Lord Egremont
sent for me, and informed me that the
Indians were to be landed at Charles Town;
but this was so contrary to their inclination,
that Ostenaco positively declared, that, unless
he was to land in Virginia, he would not stir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>a step from London. His Lordship then desired
me to tell them that they should land at
Virginia, but at the same time gave me to
understand, that the ship being to be stationed
at Charles Town, they must absolutely be
landed there. I informed his Lordship that
it was entirely out of my power to accompany
them there, having scarce five shillings remaining
out of the 130 pounds I had received,
the best part of which I laid out for the Indians
use, rather than apply to Mr. Cacanthropos;
that I was ready to obey his Lordship, if he
would please to order me wherewith to defray
my expences from Charles Town to Virginia.
My Lord replied, that no more could be advanced;
that if I refused to accompany them,
others must be found that would.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sumpter was immediately sent for by Mr.
Wood; but he refused the employ till he had
obtained my approbation; nay, I was obliged
to use the most persuasive arguments to determine
him to go; so that it was then in my
power (had I been the man I was represented)
to have made what terms I pleased, since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Indians would not have gone without one of
us, and Sumpter had too much honour to accompany
them to my prejudice. I scorned so
low an action; but told Sumpter, that tho’ I
had only asked my expences, which might amount
to about twenty or twenty-five pounds,
there was a difference between his going and
mine; that he must make the voyage in the
view of advantage, whereas I had sought none
in it, except returning to my native country.
The terms agreed on were fifty pounds in
hand, and a hundred on his arrival; and it
was even in his power to insist on more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had I really had the money, I should not
have troubled the government, or deserted the
Indians; but to be landed in a strange country
without money, and far from my friends,
did not seem very eligible. I was extremely
rejoiced at the young man’s advantage; yet
could not but think it hard to be left in England
for so small, so reasonable a demand, as
no other business than the Indian affairs had
brought me there, when seven times the sum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>was granted to another. Lord Egremont indeed
had informed me that the King, in consideration
of my services in the Cherokee country,
had ordered me a Lieutenancy in an old
regiment, which I should receive from Sir
Jeffery Amherst in North America, and positively
assured me, I should never be reduced
to half-pay; so that, had I been in my own
country, I had reason to be satisfied; but I
had no money to carry me there.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Indians soon re-imbarked in the same
vessel that brought them, and left England
about the 25th of August; so that I was now
entirely at my own expence, without money
or friends. I continually solicited Lord Egremont
for money sufficient to defray my passage
to Virginia, during which my circumstances
were continually growing worse. I disclosed
my distressed situation to a Gentleman with
whom I had contracted an intimacy, who advised
me to present a petition to the King, assuring
me at the same time, that he would
speak to a Nobleman of his acquaintance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>second it. I went to the Park next morning
with a petition that my friend approved, but
was very irresolute whether to deliver it or
not; my necessities, however, at last determined
me.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some days after I was sent for by Mr.
Wood, who, after a short reverie, told me,
that Lord Egremont had ordered a hundred
pounds, <em>if that would do</em>. I knew from
whence these orders came; but, as he industriously
avoided mentioning the petition, I
only answered that it would. I was since informed,
that two hundred pounds were ordered
me; but even one had been sufficient,
had I received it at one payment; but getting
it at different times, before I had paid my
debts, and received it all, I was again run
short.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon applying to the treasury for this money,
I was asked by Mr. M—t-n if I was not
the person that accompanied the Cherokees to
England? On answering in the affirmative, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>desired me to revise Mr. Cacanthropos’s accounts,
exclaiming against their extravagance.
On looking over them, I did not find them
quite so extravagant as I expected, being only
overcharged by about 150 pounds; but what I
mean by overcharging, is what the Indians
never had; for I cannot be so sensible of what
was overcharged by other means. <em>The Indians
being remarkable for their skill in mathematics,
but unfortunate in not having sufficient
workmen among them, he had wisely stocked the
whole nation with instruments.</em> Mr. W——
the optician’s bill being to the amount, as
near as I can remember, of fifty odd pounds
in these costly play-things for the Cherokees;
but as neither they nor I had ever seen or
heard of such instruments, although I was desired
to order all things they might have occasion
for, as best judge of what was necessary,
I am inclined to think they were turned to a
much better purpose. There was another bill
from Mr. L—d for stocks and stockings, to
the amount of forty odd pounds. Wampum,
I suppose, is become so scarce among the Indians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>that they are resolved to adopt the English
custom of stocks. It is a little unconscionable
to have forty pounds worth in change;
but then Mr. Cacanthropos can easily account
for that. These people wear a great deal of
vermilion, and are naturally not over cleanly, so
of consequence their stocks would very soon be
dirty; besides, they cannot be expected to
wear so long as everlasting wampum. Very
true! very provident, Sir! And I suppose you
presume too the bushes would tear a great
many stockings; but if I can judge of Indians,
they are a great deal wiser than to be fine
in stockings among the briars, at the expence
of their legs, which good leggons keep unscratched,
and a great deal warmer. This
does not however, dear Sir, prevent my admiring
your provident views; they are absolutely
too striking ever to admit of that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Five yards of superfine dove-coloured cloth,
at a guinea a yard, was charged at the woollen-draper’s.
Ah! dear Sir, you were short sighted
here; two yards and three-quarters make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>match-coat and leggons, five yards will not
make two; a coarser cloth would have suited
Indians, and another colour would have pleased
them much better; for I am much mistaken if
these are not the only Indians that ever wore
other than their favourite colours of red and
blue; but the laceman’s bill will clear up this
affair. Let me see! Vellum lace, broad and
narrow: Was it for button holes for a Cherokee
mantle? Sure Ostenaco never once had
the ridiculous fancy of putting useless, and
solely ornamental, buttons upon a match-coat;
where the duce then were the button-holes
placed? But I may, I believe, give a history of
that affair, without being matter of an uncommon
penetration. A certain <em>Man-Killer</em> wanting
a holiday suit to appear in, at the installation
of some royal and noble knights of the garter—but
here some critic, a pretended judge of Indian
affairs, will perhaps say, that Indians have
no such installations, and that they would never
become the laughing-stock of their countrymen,
by being swathed up in English cloaths. Well,
sharp-eyed critic, good cloaths will never want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>wearers; it is a pity good things should be lost,
and the gentleman that provided them most
absolutely be obliged to wear them himself, since
the Indians will not. What goodness! Condescend
to wear the Indians refusals! <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O tempora!
O mores!</span></i> The washerwoman’s bill,
with many others, I had already paid; but as it
had not paid toll <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</span></i>, it found its way
into the treasury, with an increase of five or six
pounds, being just as much again as the contents
of the bill; so summing up the gentleman’s
profits on what was really received, I imagined
it to be about <em>cent. per cent.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Martin desired me to take the accounts
home to revise at my leisure, which I soon after
returned with alterations, little to the honour of
the original accomptant, however great his
skill in figures. But as his character has been
sufficiently known in several late affairs, I shall
spend no more of my time, or the reader’s patience,
in quoting numerable instances of the
same dye. I shall only mention the injury
done to Mr. Quin, whose house was so spoiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>by the rabble that came to see the Indians, that
he was at a great expence to put it to rights;
but instead of Mr. Cacanthropos’s allowing out
of the immense profits of the show, wherewith
to repair the damage, he got him to sign a receipt
in full, and then curtailed and perquisited
three pounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it is now time to return to my own misfortunes.
After paying the debts I had contracted,
my finances were, as I have already
hinted, so low, that I had not wherewith to defray
my passage. I made no doubt of getting
credit for a part till my arrival. At the Virginia
Coffee-house I found a Captain of my acquaintance,
bound to Virginia, into whose
hands I deposited ten guineas to secure my passage;
but the ship, thro’ some unaccountable
delays, did not quit her moorings till December,
when the Captain told me she would go round
to Portsmouth, which place he thought would
be more convenient for me to embark at. I
readily acquiesced with this, as I thought my
passage would be long enough without any addition.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>But before I arrived at Portsmouth,
my money ran so short, that I was forced
to borrow of the landlord, to pay the last
stage. I had staid here nine or ten days, in
expectation of the ship, when a letter arrived
from the Captain, to define me to return immediately
to London, or repair to Deal, as
his employers had sent him orders not to touch
at Portsmouth, but to proceed immediately to
sea. I was thunderstruck. The tavern-keeper
had just sent in his bill for payment, the instant
I received this letter. I was obliged to deposit
cloaths and other effects to the amount of forty
pounds, and borrow ten guineas to return.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as I arrived at London, I sent my
servant to enquire if the ship had fallen down
the river, who shortly after returned with information
that she had. I then went to Gravesend,
where my money running short again, I
had recourse to the landlady. I sent to the office,
to know if such a ship had cleared, and
was agreeably informed there had not. After
expecting the ship four or five days, I sent my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>servant to London, to procure some money
on my watch, with orders to inquire after
the ship at every place between London and
Gravesend. On his return the next day he informed
me the ship, with several more, were
frozen up at Deptford. I now began to be
under the greatest uneasiness about my return
to Virginia, fate seeming determined to detain
me where misfortunes daily increased. I sent
to the Captain for the ten guineas I had advanced
for my passage, since I found it impossible
to go with him, and returned to London,
where my first concern was, to enquire at the
war-office whether there had lately arrived
any returns from Sir Jeffery Amherst? I was
informed there had, and, on turning over the
books, found myself appointed Lieutenant in
the forty-second or Royal Highland regiment
of foot, with several months subsistence due
to me, which I received soon after from Mr.
Drummond, the agent, to whom I made
known my circumstances, intreating him to
lend me fifty pounds more, without which I
found it impossible to get out of England. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>obligingly told me, that if I could get any
gentleman to accept a bill payable in four
months, he would willingly advance that sum.
I applied to a gentleman in the city, who was
kind enough to accept the bill.</p>

<p class='c011'>I agreed with a Captain of a ship bound to
Virginia, about the middle of March, and
paid him thirty-two guineas for my wife’s
passage and my own; for I had married, or
rather made a young lady a companion of my
misfortunes some time before; but her father
having refused his consent to our union, had the
barbarity to deny us the least assistance, nay,
refused me even ten guineas that I found deficient,
after paying my debts, and laying in
what was necessary. All affairs being seemingly
settled, I went to Billingsgate over-night
to save expences, by going in a Gravesend
boat the next day, but was prevented by
a bailiff, who, as soon as I was up, arrested me,
at the suit of a person, who, not making any
demand upon me, in my confusion I forgot, or
rather did not know where to find.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>I was carried immediately to Wood-Street
Compter, where I wrote to a friend for money
to discharge it but being disappointed, I
was obliged to pay away the little I had reserved
for my expences, so that I had but two
shillings left. We now embarked for Gravesend;
but before we had got two miles down
the river, the boat ran foul of a ship’s hawser,
by which we were almost overset. We staid a
considerable time, to no purpose, to get her
clear, but were obliged at last to go ashore
and return to Billingsgate, where we staid all
night, and next morning, for want of money
to discharge our reckoning, I was forced to
sell a gold seal that cost me four guineas, for
only eleven shillings.</p>

<p class='c011'>I then embarked in another boat, and got
within four miles of Gravesend without any
further interruption; but the tide being spent
here, we were obliged to walk to Gravesend
on foot, where the ship came down, and anchored
next morning.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>The Captain informed me, that two gentlemen
and a lady, passengers in the ship,
would be glad that we should all dine together.
This I readily consented to, but begged
a couple of guineas that I had been deficient
in my old reckoning at the White-Hart. Unwilling
to borrow any more from the Captain,
I sent my servant with a pair of new
crimson velvet breeches that cost me three
guineas, who returned with thirteen shillings
that he had raised on them. Being now on
board, I thought myself secure from all further
demands or impediments; but we no
sooner arrived in the Downs than my servant
left me, and demanded four guineas for the
time he had served me; a gentleman that was
going ashore did me the favour to pay him
the money he demanded.</p>

<p class='c011'>This detail may seem very dry to a reader;
but this must effectually convince the public,
that had I made money of the Indians, nay,
partook of the great sums that were clandestinely
made by them, I should not have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>so soon reduced to the necessities I underwent.</p>

<p class='c011'>After some difficulties in getting out, we
had a very good passage to Virginia. I staid
there but just long enough to settle my affairs,
and then set out for New York to wait on Sir
Jeffery Amherst for my commission; but to
save the expences of going by land, I embarked
in an old worm-eaten sloop that belonged
to a gentleman at New York, who had
been obliged to send a Captain to bring her
home, her former one having deserted her in
that ruinous condition. She had, however,
tolerable pumps and sails, and three good
hands besides the Captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first day the wind was very fair, and
gave us hopes it would continue so the whole
passage, but shifting next day to the northwest
quarter, we experienced a perfect hurricane,
in which the vessel made water so fast,
that the men were constantly at the pumps to
clear her. The sea ran so high, and the vessel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>was so old and crazy, that I expected each
wave would dash her to pieces; the third day
we shewed a little sail, though it continued
blowing very fresh till evening, when it became
pretty fair; yet she still made water at a
prodigious rate, and extremely fatigued the
men. We saw land next day, but were becalmed
till the morning after, when a fresh
gale springing up fair, we went at the rate of
eight knots an hour till four in the afternoon,
when a pilot came on board; the Captain told
him that he must run the vessel quite to New
York that night, as he had no cable to bring
her to an anchor. Had I known this circumstance
before, which even the pilot was astonished
at, I should not, I believe, have trusted
so much to fair weather. We arrived, however,
safe at New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>I waited next morning on Sir Jeffery Amherst,
who gave me my commission, with orders
immediately to join my regiment, which
was then on its way to Pittsburg. I dined
with his Excellency next day; after which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>told me to wait on Col. Reid, and not be in a
hurry to join my regiment. A packet it seems
had arrived from England the same day I received
my commission, which, I suppose,
brought a list of the officers to be reduced on
half pay, and on waiting on Col. Reid, I found
I was of the number. I related Lord Egremont’s
assurances to the contrary, and produced
this his Lordship’s Letter to Sir Jeffery Amherst
in my favour.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Colonel, on perusing it, was of the same
opinion, that certainly his Lordship never intended
me to be reduced. I went again to wait
on the General; but being denied admission, I
immediately inquired for a vessel bound to Virginia,
and having at last found one, returned
home after spending between twenty and thirty
guineas to no purpose; for had it been his
Lordship’s intention to have had me reduced, I
could have been no more in a young regiment,
without sending me to New York, in North
America, for a commission.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>I remained at home till January 1764, when
the General Assembly of the colony met for the
dispatch of public business, whither I repaired to
petition for my expences from the Cherokee
country to Williamsburg; which, however,
were greatly superior to the accounts I gave in,
lest they should judge any of them unreasonable.
While my money lasted the Indians
wanted for nothing, and I am still considerably
indebted on their account.</p>

<p class='c011'>I gained a majority, and a committee was appointed
to look into my accounts, who told me
it was to be paid by the council, out of the money
for contingent charges, and not by the colony.
After waiting a considerable time, at a
very great expence, whilst urgent business required
my presence elsewhere, I at last got the
favour of Mr. Walthoe, Clerk of the Council, to
undertake presenting my petition and accounts
to the Governor and Council, in my absence,
which he did at the next meeting, and soon
after sent me the following letter.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I was quite astonished to find, on the receipt
of this letter, that these gentlemen imagined I
had made a party of pleasure to a savage country,
in the winter season; or that I went in the view
of profit, with a stock of twenty pounds worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>of goods, most of which I distributed amongst
the necessitous prisoners. Had I intended profit,
I should certainly have taken the safest way,
and a sufficient quantity of goods to have recompensed
me for all my fatigues and danger, as I
surely did not expect presents in the Cherokee
country.</p>

<p class='c011'>I went to convince the Indians of our sincerity,
to know the navigation, and to serve my country.
Let others take care how they precipitate
themselves to serve so ungrateful a ——.
But the reader, by this time, is too well acquainted
with the particulars of my journey, to
pass judgment with these gentlemen. I have
already shewn, that my expences and losses,
during that unfortunate jaunt, was upwards of
an hundred pounds in ready money, besides
what I gave them in presents at their return to
their own country, and what I am still indebted
for on their account.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was objected, that I was not ordered. I
own it. Do they know Col. Stephen? Did he
ever order any officer on such a service? Is my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>service of less merit, because I offered myself
to do what, tho’ necessary, he could not well
command? Does the brave volunteer, who
desires to mount the breach, merit less than the
coward, whose officer compells him to it? No,
certainly. We should praise and countenance
such forwardness; yet for this same reason
have I been refused my expences. Can any
one think Col. Stephen would command any
officer amongst a savage and unsettled enemy,
whose hands were still reeking, as I may say,
with the blood of Demeré and the garrison of
Fort Loudoun, massacred after they had capitulated,
and were marching home according to
agreement, who have no laws, and are both
judges and executors of their revenge?</p>

<p class='c011'>I had no written orders. I never doubted
they would be called in question, tho’ verbal.
But here are some extracts of two of Col. Stephen’s
letters to me, while in the Cherokee
country, that may clear up this particular. In
one dated Fort Lewis, January 30, 1762, he says,
“Give my compliments to your best friends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>and I should have been extremely glad to
have heard that Judd’s Friend (i. e. Ostenaco)
had received the small present I sent him from
the Great Island. I know no reason which
will prevent you and Judd’s Friend taking
your own time to come in, and should be glad
to see you, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In another, dated Fort Lewis, February 14,
1762, he says, “The Governor is extremely
pleased with Judd’s Friend’s favours to you,
and the kindness of all the Cherokees, and I
think it is the better how soon the chiefs
come in with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I was to bring some chiefs in then: this has
likewise been disputed?</p>

<p class='c011'>But if I had no written orders, those given to
Shorey will prove my verbal ones. The original,
among my other papers, is in Mr. Walthoe’s
hands; but the substance, as near as I
can recollect, was as follows: “William Shorey,
you are to wait at Fort Lewis for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>coming of Mr. Timberlake, and accompany
Judd’s Friend in quality of interpreter to
Williamsburg. I can rely more upon you
than on M‘Cormack. Pray put the country
to as little expence as possible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Through these continual series of ill fortunes,
I got so much in debt, that I was obliged to sell
my paternal estate and negroes. My friends
advised me to return to London, promising to
send me their tobacco, and I to make returns
in such goods as would best suit the country,
of which I was a tolerable judge. I communicated
this project to many of my acquaintances,
who gave me great encouragement, and
promises of assistance. Mr. Trueheart, a gentleman
of Hanover county, so much approved
it, that he proposed himself a partner in the undertaking,
as a voyage to England might be the
means of recovering his health, then much on the
decline. I did not hesitate to accept the proposals
of a person of fortune, who could advance money
to carry it into execution. We accordingly begun
our preparations for the voyage, which were already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in some degree of readiness, when walking
one day in Mr. Trueheart’s fields, I perceived
five Indians coming towards the house, in company
with one of Mr. Trueheart’s sons, whom,
upon a nearer view, I recollected to be some of
my Cherokee acquaintance. I enquired of
Mr. Trueheart where he found them? He
told me at Warwick, enquiring for me, and
overjoyed when he offered to conduct them
to his father’s house, where I was, since they
had feared being obliged to go a great way to
seek me.</p>

<p class='c011'>After eating and smoaking, according to custom,
the headman told me he had orders to find
me out, even should I be as far off as New-York,
to accompany them to Williamsburg,
being sent with a talk to the Governor, about
business of the greatest consequence, and the
headman hoped I was too much their friend to
refuse them that favour. I replied, that the
behaviour of the Cherokees to me, while in
their country, obliged me to return what lay in
my power while they were in mine; that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>would never refuse anything that could be of any
advantage to them, but do every thing to serve
them. After resting a couple of days, we set
out, and in two more arrived at Williamsburg.
They waited next morning on the Governor to
disclose their business, which the headman afterwards
told me, was to demand a passage to
England, as encroachments were daily made upon
them, notwithstanding the proclamation issued
by the King to the contrary; that their hunting
grounds, their only support, would be soon entirely
ruined by the English; that frequent
complaints had been made to the Governors to
no purpose, they therefore resolved to seek redress
in England. Next day a council met on
the occasion, and an answer promised the day
following. As I had some particular business
with the Governor, I waited on him the morning
the Indians were to have their answer. The
chief of what the Governor said concerning
them was, that they should have applied to
Capt. Stuart, at Charles Town, he being superintendant
for Indian affairs; that if the white
people encroached, he saw no way to prevent it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>but by repelling them by force. I no sooner
left the Governor than the Indians came to wait
on him. I am unacquainted with what passed
during this interval; but the interpreter came
just after to my lodgings, and told me their
demand was refused; that the headman, who
was then down at the Capitol, intended to go
to New-York for a passage; on which I rode
down there, to take my leave of them. The
interpreter then told me, that the headman intreated
me to take them to England, as he understood
by Mr. Trueheart’s people that I was
going over. I replied, that however willing to
do the Cherokees any favour, it was utterly out
of my power to do that, as their passage would
be a great expence, and my finances ran so low,
I could scarce defray my own. I should then
have objected the Governor’s orders to the contrary,
if any such had ever been given; but I
am apt to think they came in a private letter to
England many months afterwards. I strove to
shuffle the refusal on Mr. Trueheart, hinting
that he was a person of fortune, and had it in
his power; on which they returned back with
me, and applied to him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>On my return, I acquainted Mr. Trueheart
with the whole affair, who, moved by their intreaties,
and a sense of the injustice done to
these unfortunate people, who daily see their
possessions taken away, yet dare not oppose it,
for fear of engaging in a war with so puissant an
enemy, contrary to my expectation, agreed to
bring them over. One of them died before
we set out, but we proceeded with the other
four to York Town. We were already embarked,
and weighing anchor, when Mr.
Trueheart finding the cabin much lumbered,
resolved to take his passage in another vessel.
We were scarce out of York River, when the
wind shifted directly contrary, and in a little
time blew so hard, that we were obliged to let
go another anchor, the vessel having dragged
the first a considerable way. We got to sea in
a day or two after, and proceeded on our voyage
to Bristol. The day we made land, one of
the Indians, brother to Chucatah the headman,
died suddenly. We saw a ship lying off Lundy,
which we found, on speaking with, to be the
same Mr. Trueheart was on board, and that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>son had died on the passage. In a day or two
after our arrival, we set out for London, where
the day after we arrived I went, as Mr. Trueheart
knew nothing of the town, to acquaint
Lord H—— of the Indians arrival; but his
Lordship was not at home. I called again
next day, but received the same answer. I went
some time after to the office, and acquainted
one of the Under-Secretaries with their business,
who told me, as well as I can remember,
that his Lordship would have nothing to do
with them, as they did not come over by authority;
at which Mr. Trueheart and the Indians
were greatly displeased: that gentleman,
then, to lessen the expences as much as possible,
took a cheap lodging in Long’s-Court, Leicester-Fields,
for himself and the Indians, where,
after a short illness, he died on the 6th of November.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was a great loss to me, and likely to
be severely felt by the Indians, who must have
perished, had I not taken care of them, and
promised payment for their board, &amp;c. I never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>indeed doubted but when Lord H——
should be informed with the true situation of
affairs, he would readily reimburse me; I sent
him a letter for that purpose, but received no
answer. The Indians began to be very uneasy
at so long a confinement, as my circumstances
would not permit their going so often to public
diversions as they should have done. They,
therefore, begged to come and live with
me.</p>

<p class='c011'>I some time after, the better to accommodate
them, took a house, and gave my note for
their board, which came to £. 29 : 13 : 6.
I wrote again to Lord H——, and received a
verbal answer at the office, from Mr.
St—h—e, which was, that his Lordship took
very ill my troubling him with those letters:
that since I had brought the Indians here, I
should take them back, or he would take such
measures as I should not like. I replied,
something hastily, that I had not brought the
Indians, neither would I carry them back:
that his Lordship might take what measures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>he pleased; which I suppose offended a courtier
accustomed to more deceitful language.
I am a soldier, and above cringing or bearing
tamely an injury.</p>

<p class='c011'>But should these people commence a war,
and scalp every encroacher, or even others, to
revenge the ill treatment they received while
coming in a peaceable manner to seek redress
before they had recourse to arms, let the
public judge who must answer it; I must,
however, lay great part of the blame on Mr.
Cacoanthropos, who, possessing the ear of Lord
H——, made such an unfavourable report of
me, that either his Lordship believed, or pretended
to believe them impostors, or Indians
brought over for a shew. They were known
by several gentlemen in London to be of
power in their own country; and had not the
government been convinced of that, I scarce
think they would have sent them home at all.
As to his other suspicion, even when I had
been so great a loser, without hopes of redress,
I might have justified making a shew of them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>but they were quite private;  few knew there
were such people in London. Nay, I did not
enough disabuse the public when that impostor,
who had taken the name of Chucatah,
was detected; so the public, without further
examination, imagined Chucatah himself to
be the impostor. What contributed greatly
to raise this report, was, that three Mohock
Indians were, after making the tour of England
and Ireland, made a shew of in the
Strand, and immediately confounded by the
public with the Cherokees, and I accused of
making a shew all over England of Indians
who never stirred out of London. Had I
showed them, I should not have been under
such anxiety to have them sent away; I should
have wished their stay, or been able to have
sent them back without any inconveniency in
raising the necessary money for that purpose:
but as it was entirely out of my power, I was
advised to put in an advertisement for a public
contribution; I first, however, resolved to present
a petition to the Board of Trade, in answer
to which Lord H——h told me, that it no way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>concerned them, but Lord H——, to whom
I must again apply. On a second application,
Lord H——h agreed I should be paid for the
time they remained in London, and that he
would take care to have them sent home. I
was allowed two guineas a week for the month
they stayed afterwards in town; but from Mr.
Trueheart’s death, what in cloaths, paint, trinkets,
coach-hire, and other expences, including
the bill from their late lodgings (for which I
was arrested, and put to a considerable expence)
and the time they had lived with me, I had expended
near seventy pounds, which I must enevitably
lose, as Lord H—— has absolutely
refused to reimburse me.</p>

<p class='c011'>About the beginning of March 1765, by
the desire of Mr. Montague, I accompanied
the Indians on board the Madeira packet, in
which they returned to their own country,
leaving me immersed in debts not my own,
and plunged into difficulties thro’ my zeal to
serve both them and my country, from which
the selling of twenty pounds a year out of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>commission has rather allayed than extricated
me. The Indians expressed the highest gratitude
and grief for my misfortunes; all the recompence
they could offer, was an asylum in
their country, which I declined; since their
murmurs, and some unguarded expressions
they dropt, convinced me they would not fail
at their return to spirit up their countrymen,
to vindicate their right by force of arms, which
would infallibly again have been laid to my
charge, and I perhaps be reputed a traitor to
my country. My circumstances, however, are
now so much on the decline, that when I can
satisfy my creditors, I must retire to the Cherokee,
or some other hospitable country, where
unobserved I and my wife may breathe upon
the little that yet remains.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
